	- | {{youtube-timestamp 00:00}} |
	  | So what I have here is the Inster 360x. | 여기 있는 것은 인스터 360x입니다. |
	  | You've probably seen some clips from this camera in my videos where I use it to document the trip from one place to another or just to add some extra to the video giving you a wider field of view of the surroundings around me. | 아마도 제 영상에서 이 카메라의 클립 중 일부를 보셨을 겁니다. 제가 이를 사용하여 한 장소에서 다른 곳으로 여행을 기록하거나 비디오에 추가로 더해 일상 주변 환경을 더 넓게 볼 수 있도록 합니다. |
	  | So in today's video, I'm going to tell you everything there is to know about the X3 and also to get the best possible footage out of this how to export | 그래서 오늘의 영상에서는 X3에 대해 알아야 할 모든 것을 알려드리고, 최상의 영상을 어떻게 내보낼 수 있는지 알려드리겠습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 00:27}} |
	  | the settings I use and how convenient it is to have something like this because this is not like any other action camera on the market. | 내가 사용하는 설정과 이것과 같은 것을 가지는 것이 얼마나 편리한 지, 왜냐하면 시장에 있는 다른 액션 카메라와는 다르기 때문입니다. |
	  | Now the INSTA 360 X3 comes with two half inch 48 megapixel sensors, a massive 2.1 inch touch screen, the ability to shoot me mode, HDR and 8K time lapses. | 이제 INSTA 360 X3는 2개의 반인치 48메가픽셀 센서, 거대한 2.1인치 터치 스크린, 미 모드 촬영이 가능하며, HDR, 8K 타임랩스를 제공합니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 00:54}} |
	  | How awesome is that with industry leading flow state stabilization and a single lens mode which allows you to shoot videos just like any other action camera and 72 megapixel photos. Is it really the only camera you need? Let's find out. | 산업 선두의 플로우 상태 안정화와 단일 렌즈 모드로 멋지게 촬영할 수 있으며 72메가픽셀 사진을 찍을 수 있습니다. 정말 당신이 필요로 하는 유일한 카메라인가요? 알아보도록 합시다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 02:58}} |
	  | So one of the reasons you would want to get a 360 camera is the overall versatility it gives compared to the standard action camera. | 360 카메라를 구매하고 싶은 이유 중 하나는 일반 액션 카메라와 비교했을 때 제공하는 전반적인 다양성입니다. |
	  | So if you want to go from a blogging style perspective to reveal a shot of your destination or capture a fast cinematic beerll, you would most likely end up changing the direction of how your camera is pointing and mounted. | 블로깅 스타일의 관점에서 여행지 촬영을 공개하거나 빠른 시네마틱 비롤을 촬영하려면 카메라의 방향과 장착 방법을 바꿀 가능성이 높습니다. |
	  | And maybe you want to double check your shot before so you make sure that you didn't miss it. | 그리고 아마도 촬영하기 전에 샷을 다시 확인하고 놓치지 않았는지 확인하고 싶을 것입니다. |
	- |{{youtube-timestamp 03:23}}|
	  |But with the 360 camera, you will never miss the shot. | 360 카메라를 사용하면 샷을 놓칠 일이 없습니다.|
	  |Basically, it films everything 360 degrees so you won't miss the shot. | 기본적으로, 모든 것을 360도로 촬영하여 샷을 놓칠 일이 없습니다.|
	  |An example here is this PV shot where I'm holding the camera behind me creating this awesome third-person view. | 여기 예시가 있습니다. 제가 카메라를 뒤에 들고 멋진 제삼자 시점을 만드는 PV 샷입니다.|
	  |But by just pulling the camera in front of me, I have the typical blogging style perspective. | 하지만 카메라를 앞으로 당기면 전형적인 블로깅 스타일의 시각을 얻습니다.|
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 03:41}} | 
	  | And with the install 360 Studio up on your phone or desktop, you can easily adjust the sum and the direction to get your preferred angle. | 360 스튜디오를 휴대전화나 데스크탑에 설치하면 쉽게 각도와 방향을 조절하여 원하는 각도를 얻을 수 있습니다. |
	  | Now what I found to be a few cones with a regular camera or a regular action camera, it is that you will always have a selfish stake in your frame. | 일반 카메라나 액션 카메라로 발견한 몇 가지 문제는 항상 자신이 프레임 안에 있게 된다는 것입니다. |
	  | And let's say if you want to go from the perspective here to a Pio vicha of my son, | 그리고 예를 들어 여기서 내 아들의 시점으로 가고 싶다고 해 봅시다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 04:03}} |
	  | then I need to adjust the camera to get a clean shot if I don't want the selfie stick to be in the frame | 그럼 셀카봉이 화면에 들어가지 않도록 깨끗한 샷을 얻기 위해 카메라를 조정해야 해요. |
	  | also trying to do a third person view with the regular action camera, it's not going to look good at all. | 그리고 일반 액션 카메라로 써드 페르슨 뷰를 시도하려고 해도 전혀 좋지 않아 보일 거에요. |
	  | It looks so weird. So if you want to get shots like that, you really want to have something like a camera. | 정말 이상하게 보여요. 그래서 그런 샷을 원하면 카메라 같은 걸 써야 해요. |
	  | So with the 360 camera and the invisible selfish stick, I don't have to worry about any | 그래서 360 카메라와 보이지 않는 셀피쉬 스틱을 사용하면 아무런 걱정 없이 즐길 수 있어요. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 04:26}} |
	  | this. I can just put it in my backpack, hold it behind me or in front of me and then later just reframe everything in the studio app or by using the free go Pro reframe atom for Premier Pro or after effect. | 이것은 나는 그냥 가방에 넣고, 뒤나 앞에 들고나서 나중에 스튜디오 앱에서 모든 것을 다시 구상하거나 프리미어 프로나 애프터 이펙트에서 무료로 제공되는 go Pro reframe atom을 사용할 수 있습니다. |
	  | Now let's talk about the key features of the X 3 here and why I think this is the perfect addition to your setup. First, we have the upgraded half inch sensors on the X3 which gives you a resolution of up to 5.7k, up to 30 FPS. | 이제 X 3의 주요 기능에 대해 얘기하고, 나는 이것이 당신의 설정에 완벽한 추가라고 생각하는 이유에 대해 이야기해 보겠습니다. 먼저, X3의 업그레이드된 반인치 센서가 있어 최대 5.7k, 최대 30 FPS의 해상도를 제공합니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 04:54}} |
	  | And this will also bring better low light capabilities and a crisper image in bright conditions with active HTR. | 그리고 이는 더 나은 어두운 조건에서의 낮은 빛 성능 및 밝은 조건에서는 더 선명한 이미지를 제공합니다. 활성 HTR을 사용하면 이미지가 개선됩니다. |
	  | The upgraded image sensor gives you a whooping 72 megapixel photos which looks amazing. | 업그레이드된 이미지 센서는 놀라운 72메가픽셀 사진을 제공합니다. 그것은 놀라운 것을 보입니다. |
	  | Now the photos coming from this has to be processed in the studio but this also gives you the option to reframe and save the image you want something you can't do with a standard action camera. | 이제 이것에서 나오는 사진들은 스튜디오에서 처리되어야 하지만, 이는 당신에게 리프레임하고 원하는 이미지를 저장할 수 있는 선택권을 제공합니다. 일반 액션 카메라로는 할 수 없는 것입니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 05:18}} |
	  | With the standard action camera, you take the photo you want at that direction and you can't really go back and reframe and select a different, a photo from a different angle later. So basically the photo you take is what you get and you will have to turn around to the different directions to take multiple photos of everything. But with a 360 camera, you snap one shot and you have everything and I think that is really awesome and you can reframe it exactly how you want in the studio. | 표준 액션 카메라로 원하는 방향에 사진을 찍을 수 있지만 다시 돌아가 보정하거나 다른 각도에서 다음 사진을 선택할 수는 없습니다. 따라서 찍은 사진이 얻는 결과이며 모든 것에 대해 여러 장의 사진을 찍기 위해 서로 다른 방향으로 서로 제자리를 돌아야합니다. 그러나 360 카메라로 하나의 샷을 찍으면 모든 것이 담기며 이것이 정말 멋지다고 생각하며 스튜디오에서 정확히 원하는대로 다시 구성할 수 있습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 05:45}} |
	  | again, it's really convenient. | 다시 말하지만, 정말 편리합니다. |
	  | Now what I really like with the X3 is the single lens mode. | X3에서 싱글 렌즈 모드로 좋아하는 것 |
	  | It gives me that standard action camera look without needing to reframe the shot later just a running gun. | 나에게 표준 액션 캠 룩을 제공하며 최후에 재프레임할 필요 없이 그냥 진행 도중 실행할 수 있게 합니다. |
	  | Unfortunately, we're limited to 4k 30 and I wish we had at least 50 FPS but 4K 30 is still doing an amazing job to be honest. | 유감스럽게도, 4k 30으로 제한되어 있고 적어도 50 FPS가 있었으면 했지만 솔직히 말해서 4K 30은 여전히 놀랍게 잘하고 있습니다. |
	  | Now talking about ME mode, this just has to be the perfect feature if you're out doing some blogging or if you just want to be center framed throughout the entire | 이제 ME 모드에 대해 이야기해보면, 이것은 블로깅을 하거나 전체 과정 동안 중앙에 맞춰져 있기를 원하는 경우 완벽한 기능이어야 합니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 06:14}} |
	  | shot. What the memode does is basically active tracking the subject and making sure that the subject is always in frame which is really awesome and you don't have to worry about how you hold. The camera is always going to track you anyway. Now the only downside is that you're limited to 10 ATP up to 6 FPS but in good conditions, in bright conditions, it's actually doing a pretty good job. | memode가 하는 것은 기본적으로 주제를 능동적으로 추적하고 주제가 항상 프레임 내에 있다는 것을 보장하는 것입니다. 그것은 정말 멋진데, 어떻게 들고 있는지 걱정할 필요가 없습니다. 카메라가 항상 당신을 추적할 것입니다. 이제 유일한 단점은 10 ATP까지 6 FPS로 제한되지만, 좋은 환경에서는 실제로 아주 잘하고 있습니다. | 
	  | Now let's talk about the screen of the instal 360x. | 이제 인스탈 360x의 화면에 대해 이야기해 보겠습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 06:43}} |
	  | This is huge. | 이건 엄청난 일입니다. |
	  | Now I've said the screen on the Action three is by far the best screen I've used but this is coming straight at it with a lot of power. | 지금까지 사용해본 것 중 Action three의 스크린이 최고라고 했지만 이것은 힘을 행사하며 바로 직면합니다. |
	  | It's super responsive and navigating through the settings is extremely satisfying. | 매우 반응이 빠르고 설정을 탐색하는 것이 매우 만족스럽습니다. |
	  | It feels like you're swiping on a phone. | 휴대폰에서 스와이프하는 것 같은 느낌입니다. |
	  | Now on the X3 itself, here we have a dedicated record button next to a custom button which you can set to switch between | X3 자체에는 이제 여기 녹화 전용 버튼과 사용자 정의 버튼이 옆에 있습니다. 이 버튼은 전환할 수 있습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 07:09}} |
	  | lenses whether you want to record with the lens on the front or the back in a single lens mode or use both to shoot a. | 렌즈는 당신이 전면 렌즈 또는 후면 렌즈로 녹화하고 싶은지, 단일 렌즈 모드로 사용할지 또는 양측 렌즈를 사용하여 촬영할지 여부를 결정합니다. | 
	  | You can also set this to take a photo or record a video. But since we have the dedicated record button on the left hand side, I would keep this sitching lenses because it's going to be so much more convenient when you go back and forth between the different editing styles whether you want to use the single lens or a 30 | 사진을 찍거나 비디오를 녹화하도록 이 설정을 변경할 수도 있습니다. 하지만 좌측면에 전용 녹화 버튼이 있기 때문에, 당신이 단일 렌즈를 사용할지 30을 사용할지 여부에 관계없이 다른 편집 스타일 사이를 왔다갔다하는 경우에 훨씬 더 편리해질 것입니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 07:33}} |
	  | camera. On the side, we have the power on off button and a quick switch button to select a pre made profile or your own custom made profile. On the other side, we have the upgraded 1800 million power battery which also holds your S car and above that you have the USBC connection to transfer media or charge your. Now the X3 also has four microphones with direction focus. | 카메라. 한 쪽에는 전원 버튼이 있고 빠른 전환 버튼이 있어 미리 만든 프로필이나 사용자 정의 프로필을 선택할 수 있습니다. 반대편에는 업그레이드된 1800만 파워 배터리가 있으며 여기에는 귀하의 S자동차가 포함되어 있으며 그 위에 미디어를 전송하거나 충전할 수 있는 USBC 연결이 있습니다. 이제 X3에는 방향을 봐야 하는 4개의 마이크도 있습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 07:57}} |
	  | This means your audio will always come from the direction your camera is facing. | 이것은 당신의 오디오가 항상 당신의 카메라가 향한 방향에서 나온다는 것을 의미합니다. |
	  | And when you reframe your shot in the studio app, the audio will follow no matter direction, which is really awesome. | 스튜디오 앱에서 샷을 다시 구성할 때, 오디오는 어떠한 방향이든 따라갈 것이며, 이는 정말 멋진 기능입니다. |
	  | That means however you record with this and however you reframe in post if you change the direction in the studio app, the order are going to follow to that direction. | 이것은 스튜디오 앱에서 방향을 바꾼다면, 녹화하거나 포스트에서 다시프레임하든지 무슨 방법이든, 순서가 그 방향으로 따라갈 것을 의미합니다. |
	  | So if I'm talking here and another one is talking over there. | 그래서 내가 여기서 말하고, 또 다른 사람이 저기서 말하고 있다면. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 08:21}} |
	  | I can frame myself and then the audio will come from me. | 내가 나 자신을 프레임하면 오디오가 나에게서 나올 것이다. |
	  | But as soon as I turn the camera in the studio app towards the other person, the audio is going to follow to person which is really intuitive and something which you can only find with the X. | 그러나 스튜디오 앱의 카메라를 다른 사람쪽으로 돌리자마자, 오디오가 실제로 사람에게 따라갈 것이며 이는 정말 직관적이며 X에서만 찾을 수 있는 것입니다. |
	  | Now as for durability, it's also waterproof down to 10 meters or 33 feet. | 내구성에 관해서는, 이것은 10 미터 또는 33 피트까지 방수가 가능합니다. |
	  | So you don't have to worry about getting any dive cases for this if you just want to take it out for a dip and do some | 그래서 이것에 대해 다이빙 케이스를 구매해야 하는 걱정은 하지 않아도 괜찮으며, 그냥 들고 나가서 간단한 수영을 하고 몇몇을 해보고 싶다면 |
	- | basic snorkling. But if you're going to scoop a dive, anything like that which is deeper, highly recommend that you get a dive case. | 기본 스노클링. 그러나 다이빙을 하려면, 더 깊고 그러한 것들에 관하여, 다이브 케이스를 구하는 것을 강력히 권장합니다. |
	  | The X3 also has Deep Track 2.0 which easily tracks your subject or object with a single tap. | X3에는 Deep Track 2.0도 있습니다. 이는 단 한 번의 탭으로 주제나 물체를 쉽게 추적합니다. |
	  | So yeah, is it really the camera you need? | 그래서, 그것이 정말 필요한 카메라인가요? |
	  | Well, I will leave that up to you but I know for a fact that this is the perfect addition to my Gopro Hero 10 and my action and also with the other travel equipment that I bring like my Mini3 Pro and my Avata and my Soni7 | 음, 그건 당신에게 달려 있지만, 나도 모르게, 나의 Gopro Hero 10 및 내 행동과 또한 나의 Mini3 Pro, 나의 Avata 및 나의 Soni7 같은 내 다른 여행 장비에 완벽한 추가라는 사실을 알고 있습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 09:20}} |
	  | this is the perfect addition for me and this is basically recording everything around me and I can go back and reframe later by zooming in if I want to SH be closer or I can do some crazy stuff with it which looks pretty cool if you ask me. So this is, you know, this is a keeper. If I should recommend it by now, I would because it's going to make everything more fun and it's going to make your overall | 이것은 나에게 완벽한 보완이며 주변의 모든 것을 기록하고 원한다면 더 가깝게 SH되기 위해 나중에 줌을 확대해서 다시 만들거나 이것으로 어떤 미친 짓을 할 수도 있어요. 제게 물어봐 주신다면 정말 멋지게 보일 거에요. 그러니, 이건, 알지요, 이건 꼭 지킬 가치가 있는 것입니다. 만약 지금 이걸 추천해야 한다면, 나는 정말로 추천할 것입니다. 왜냐하면 이것이 모든 것을 더 재미있게 만들어 주고 전체적으로 좋게 만들어 줄 거니까 |

	  | a solar creating experience much better. | 태양 에너지를 이용하는 경험이 훨씬 더 나아졌습니다. |
	  | Because this is such a versatile camera and you can capture different angles. | 이 카메라가 매우 다재다능하기 때문에 다양한 각도를 촬영할 수 있습니다. |
	  | You can really spice up your videos by using something and also something to add to that. | 무언가를 사용하여 영상에 풍부함을 더할 수 있습니다. |
	  | This is a 360 camera so it records everything and you will never miss the shot which is | 이 카메라는 360도를 녹화하기 때문에 모든 것을 기록하며, 놓치지 않습니다. |
	- | one of the reasons that this is coming with me everywhere. | 이게 저한테 계속 지금 당장 가져가야 하는 이유 중 하나에요. |
	  | But having a 360 camera is one thing but how do you actually get the most out of this? | 하지만 360 카메라를 가지는 것은 한 가지지만 이를 가능한 최대로 활용하는 방법은 무엇일까요? |
	  | And how do you get the best quality coming from a 360 camera and especially the X? | 360 카메라와 특히 X에서 나오는 최상의 품질을 어떻게 얻을까요? |
	  | Now the key element is of course the sun. | 이제 핵심 요소는 물론 해가 됩니다. |
	  | You always want bright conditions when you're recording videos with a 360 camera. | 360 카메라로 비디오를 녹화할 때 언제나 밝은 조건이 되길 원합니다. |
	  | And there's also a few settings that you want to change before you start recording and also before you export. | 그리고 녹화를 시작하기 전에 변경하고 내보내기 전에도 변경하고 싶은 몇 가지 설정도 있습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 10:32}} |
	  | So turning on the X3 here, you want to set your record settings first. By default it should be 5.7k, 30 FPS and this is what you're going to use anyway so you don't have to change any of that. | 이제 X3을 켜면 먼저 레코드 설정을 해야 합니다. 기본적으로 5.7k, 30 FPS여야 하며 당신이 사용할 것이기 때문에 그대로 둘 필요가 있습니다. |
	  | Now if you select the camera icon, you can see all the different shooting modes and also the option to change to single lens mode. Now the first thing you should do is to go through all the different shooting modes not only the ones you'll be using the most but all. | 이제 카메라 아이콘을 선택하면 모든 다양한 촬영 모드와 싱글 렌즈 모드로 변경하는 옵션을 볼 수 있습니다. 이제 해야 할 첫 번째 일은 당신이 가장 많이 사용하는 것뿐 아니라 모든 다양한 촬영 모드를 모두 살펴보는 것입니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 10:59}} |
	  | trust me, you'll end up using them or testing them at least. | 믿어요, 적어도 사용하거나 테스트하게 될 거에요. |
	  | So you want to change the settings on them. | 그래서 당신은 그들의 설정을 변경하길 원해요. |
	  | So by starting off with changing all the settings once you get your X3, they will be locked in place. | 그래서 처음부터 X3를 가져올 때 모든 설정을 변경하면 그들은 잠기게 될 거에요. |
	  | So whenever you change to photos, HDR or time lapse, the settings you change to will stay in place unless you | 그래서 사진, HDR 또는 타임 랩스로 변경할 때마다, 바꾼 설정은 그대로 유지될 거에요. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 11:16}} |
	  | again, this makes it much faster and easier to record your next session. | 다시, 다음 세션을 기록하기가 훨씬 빨라지고 쉬워집니다. |
	  | And the same thing goes for the other settings as well like color wipeals, etc. | 그리고 색상 와이플섭등 다른 설정들에도 똑같은 원리가 적용됩니다. |
	  | So to change this, you swipe left on the screen from the right side. | 이것을 변경하려면, 오른쪽에서 화면을 왼쪽으로 스와이프합니다. |
	  | Now the settings that I use with the X3 are auto settings with a custom white balance and a custom exposure value and also the color profile Vivid. | 지금 X3와 사용하는 설정은 사용자 정의 화이트 밸런스와 사용자 정의 노출 값 및 생생한 컬러 프로필입니다. |
	  | Now as for normal settings, I use a max ISO of 800. | 일반 설정으로는 최대 ISO 800을 사용합니다. | 
	  | The shutter speed is one of 60 since I'm recording in 30 FPS. | 셔터 속도는 30 FPS로 녹화 중이기 때문에 1/60 중 하나입니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 11:46}} | 
	  | and also used the A Vivid color profile and a white balance between 5,000 and 6,000 Calvin. | 그리고 Vivid 컬러 프로필을 사용하고 5,000 ~ 6,000 켈빈 사이의 화이트 밸런스를 사용했습니다. |
	  | So these are pretty common settings and there's not much to change to be honest but where I have noticed the difference is in the sky and this actually tends to blow out sky a little bit more. | 이 설정들은 상당히 일반적이며 솔직히 변경할 것은 많지 않습니다. 그러나 제가 차이를 느낀 곳은 하늘이며 이는 사실 상대적으로 하늘이 조금 더 터진다는 것입니다. |
	  | So our PROTIP here is to decrease the exposure value to minus 0.5 or minus 1. | 그래서 여기 제 팁은 노출 값을 -0.5 또는 -1로 줄이는 것입니다. |
	  | And once you do that, you can also take a quick | 그리고 그렇게 하면 빠르게 해볼 수 있습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 12:11}} |
	  | shot of your scenery and then you can flip out your phone, go into the studio up on your phone and check out the content you recorded and then see if the sky is blown or not. And then go out from the settings that you tested and choose the correct settings for your sequence. Simplest that really, really intuitive when you have the app which makes it so much convenient | 당신의 풍경을 촬영하고 전화를 꺼내서 전화에 있는 스튜디오로 가서 녹화한 콘텐츠를 확인하고 하늘이 흐려졌는지 확인하십시오. 그런 다음 테스트한 설정으로부터 나가서 시퀀스에 대한 올바른 설정을 선택하십시오. 어플을 가지고 있을 때 정말 정말 직관적입니다. 많이 편리해집니다 |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 12:33}} |
	  | to get into the 360 world. | 360도 세계로 들어가려면. |
	  | There's also tons of awesome features that you can test out which is really cool and we're going to come back to that in a now going back to the main screen here and swiping down, we get into the quick menu. | 테스트할 수 있는 놀라운 기능이 많이 있습니다. 그것은 정말 멋지고 현재는 그에 대해 다시 돌아올 것이며 여기 메인 화면으로 돌아가서 아래로 스와이핑하면 빠른 메뉴로 이동합니다. |
	  | Here you have the settings like screen brightness, wind reduction, audio level, pre-record time, and more. | 여기에는 화면 밝기, 풍력 감소, 오디오 레벨, 사전 녹화 시간 및 기타 설정이 있습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 12:57}} |
	  | And on the bottom right section here we have the settings menu here you want to scroll down and make sure that the bit rate is set to high and the video sharpness is set to medium or low. | 여기 하단 오른쪽 섹션에 설정 메뉴가 있습니다. 여기서 아래로 스크롤하여 비트 속도가 높게 설정되어 있는지, 비디오 선명도가 중간 또는 낮게 설정되어 있는지 확인하십시오. 그래서 휴대폰에서 비디오를 내보낼 예정이라면, 이미지에 약간의 선명함을 추가하기 위해 중간으로 설정하는 것을 권장합니다. 하지만 노트북이나 데스크탑 컴퓨터를 사용하여 비디오를 조정하는 경우에는, 낮게 설정해야 합니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 13:22}} |
	  | That means you can add the sharpening in post if needed. | 필요한 경우 후에 날카로운 정도를 추가할 수 있습니다. |
	  | And this will also give you a much better image as you have more control over the sharpness. | 더 많은 제어권으로 훨씬 더 좋은 이미지를 얻을 수 있습니다. |
	  | So how do you get good quality footage from the X3? | 그렇다면 X3에서 좋은 품질의 영상을 어떻게 얻을까요? |
	  | First, you need a computer even though the INSTA 360 mobile app is fantastic and allows you to edit videos and anywhere even use crazy time lapses to create something wild. | 먼저, INSTA 360 모바일 앱이 훌륭하고 어디에서든 비디오를 편집하고 미친 타임 랩스를 사용하여 무언가를 만들 수 있지만 컴퓨터가 필요합니다. |
	  | You would need a computer to get the best image quality from this device. | 이 장치로부터 최상의 이미지 품질을 얻으려면 컴퓨터가 필요합니다. |
	  | So let's head over to the INSTA 360 Studio app. | 그럼 INSTA 360 Studio 앱으로 이동해 보겠습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 13:52}} |
	  | Now plugging in your SD card, you will get the option to select clips to import or import all. | 이제 SD 카드를 꽂으면 클립을 선택하거나 모두 가져올 수 있는 옵션이 표시됩니다. |
	  | So let's just go on and import all. | 그러니 모두 가져오기로 진행합시다. | 
	  | Now this is where you do all the magic. | 지금이 바로 마법을 부리는 곳입니다. |
	  | So if we double click on a file here, you will get a preview and on the right side of that preview screen, you can see the different sections to adjust stabilization, audio, color boosts and etc. | 여기 파일을 두 번 클릭하면 미리보기를 볼 수 있고, 이 미리보기 화면의 오른쪽에는 안정화, 오디오, 색상 부스트 등을 조절할 수 있는 다양한 섹션이 표시됩니다. |
	  | And by click holding on the video inside the previous screen, you can drag this to either side and up and down to reframe your shot. | 이전 화면에서 비디오를 클릭하고 드래그하면 좌우 및 상하로 이동하여 샷을 다시 맞출 수 있습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 14:21}} |
	  | On the bottom section you have a trim out and trim in also the audio levels, key frameworkers, deep track 2.0 and time shift and motion. | 아래 섹션에는 트림 아웃과 트림 인, 오디오 레벨, 키프레이밍, 딥 트랙 2.0, 타임 쉬프트 및 모션도 있습니다. |
	  | Now on the right side of the previous screen, you can also see it says 16 by 9 and this is the aspect. | 지난 화면의 오른쪽에도 16 대 9로 표시되어 있고 이것이 비율입니다. |
	  | Now what's really awesome here is that you can export the exact same video in both 16 by 9 and 9 by 16 for either TikTok or Instagram at the same time. | 여기서 정말 멋진 점은 동일한 비디오를 TikTok이나 Instagram에 동시에 16 대 9 및 9 대 16으로 내보낼 수 있다는 것입니다. |
	  | I will come back to that in a second. | 나중에 그것에 다시 돌아올 것입니다. |
	  | But first, let's take a look at the key framing. | 하지만 먼저 키프레이밍을 살펴보겠습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 14:49}} |
	  | So what I'm going to do is to find a position in the clip here and use the trim handles to find the in and out of the clip I want to use. | 내가 할 일은 여기 클립에서 위치를 찾고, 사용하려는 클립의 시작과 끝을 찾기 위해 트리밍 핸들을 사용하는 것이다. |
	  | And I'm also going to put a key frame at the beginning and then a reframe. | 그리고 나는 시작 부분에 키프레임을 넣을 것이고 그리고 다시 프레임을 할 것이다. |
	  | Now the next step is to go to somewhere in your video right before you want to apply a change to the angle and then make another key frame. | 이제 다음 단계는 비디오에서 원하는 각도를 변경하기 전에 가서 다른 키프레임을 만든다. |
	  | And now to the part where you want to add that change and then adjust the angle and add a new key frame. | 그리고 이제 그 변경 사항을 추가하려는 부분으로 이동하여 각도를 조정하고 새로운 키프레임을 추가한다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 15:17}} |
	  | So now we have three key frames here. | 지금 여기 우리에게 세 개의 키프레임이 있습니다. |
	  | And if we do a playback, we can see the camera changing from one position to another but something is off it doesn't have a smooth start or ending. | 만약 우리가 재생을 한다면, 카메라가 한 위치에서 다른 위치로 변경되는 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 그러나 무언가가 잘못되어 부드러운 시작이나 끝이 없습니다. |
	  | So taking a look at the yellow line between the key frames here if we click on that, you have a few options to choose from. | 그래서 여기 키프레임 사이의 노란 선을 살펴보면, 그 위를 클릭하면 몇 가지 옵션이 나타납니다. |
	  | What I found to be the best is the last option, the fade in, fade out. | 제가 가장 좋다고 생각하는 것은 마지막 옵션인 페이드 인, 페이드 아웃입니다. |
	  | So selecting this on all the lines between the key frames, our shot looks so much better. | 그래서 키프레임 사이의 모든 라인에 이 옵션을 선택하면, 우리의 샷이 훨씬 더 나아집니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 15:49}} |
	  | So I went ahead and added a few more key frames as well. | 그래서 저는 추가적으로 몇 개의 중요한 프레임도 추가했어요. |
	  | So let's export this and see how the quality comes out. | 그래서 우리 이것을 내보내서 품질이 어떻게 나오는지 봐요. |
	  | So to export this, we're going to click on the yellow button on the bottom right corner. | 이것을 내보내기 위해서, 우리는 오른쪽 하단의 노란 버튼을 클릭할 거에요. |
	  | So now we have the export settings and the location of where we want to export to. | 그래서 이제 우리는 내보내기 설정과 내보내기할 위치를 가지고 있어요. |
	  | So the export settings you want to change is the encoding format. | 그래서 바꾸고 싶은 내보내기 설정은 인코딩 형식입니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 16:13}} |
	  | We're going to change this to PROs 422. | PROs 422로 변경할 예정입니다. |
	  | We can also see that the resolution is set to 10 ATP so we're going to change this to 4k. | 해상도는 현재 10 ATP로 설정되어 있는데, 이를 4k로 변경할 것입니다. |
	  | So this is basically the only settings you have to change upon export. | 이것이 수출 시 변경해야 할 기본 설정입니다. |
	  | And you can also save this as a preset. | 또한 이것을 프리셋으로 저장할 수도 있습니다. |
	  | So the next time you export, it will automatically select this preset. | 다음 번 수출 시 자동으로 이 프리셋이 선택됩니다. |
	  | Now let's say you want to export the same video but in 9 by 16 for let's say Instagram or Tik Tok. | 이제 동일한 영상을 9:16 비율로 수출하고 싶다고 가정해봅시다. Instagram이나 Tik Tok을 위한 것이죠. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 16:38}} |
	  | Then we're just going to add this to queue. | 그럼 이걸 큐에 추가할 겁니다. |
	  | On the left side you can see the file that's ready to be exported. | 왼쪽에 내보내기 준비가 된 파일이 보입니다. |
	  | But first we're going to change the aspect of the next export to 9 by. | 하지만 먼저, 다음 내보내기의 측면을 9로 변경할 겁니다. |
	  | And once we change this again, we're going to click on the yellow export button and then add to queue but also make sure that the resolution is to 4K so that's going to be 2160 by 30,840. | 그리고 다시 이것을 변경하고, 노란색 내보내기 버튼을 클릭한 다음 큐에 추가하지만, 해상도가 4K로 설정되었는지 꼭 확인해야 합니다. 그래서 2160x30840이 될 거예요. |
	  | So just like 16 by 9 but the other way and now clicking on queue, we have the two files ready to be exported. | 그래서 16x9와 같지만 반대 방향이고, 이제 '큐'를 클릭하면 두 파일이 내보내기 준비가 됩니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 17:11}} |
	  | So now we can select both of the clips and right click and then start the exp. | 그래서 우리는 두 클립을 모두 선택한 후 마우스 오른쪽 버튼을 클릭한 다음 익스포트를 시작할 수 있습니다. |
	  | Now once we're done with the export, we can take a quick look here. | 이제 익스포트가 완료되면 여기에서 빠르게 살펴볼 수 있습니다. |
	  | This is how it looks on Instagram and this is how it looks on YouTube. | 이것이 인스타그램에서 보이는 모습이며 유튜브에서 보이는 모습입니다. |
	  | And in order to get the best possible quality coming from this, you have to export everything in progress 22 and you also have to export in 4k. | 이 작업에서의 최상의 품질을 얻기 위해서는 모든 것을 progress 22로 익스포트해야 하며 4k로도 익스포트해야 합니다. |
	  | And you also have to do some adjustments in post-production like maybe adding | 그리고 또한 post-production에서 조정 작업을 해야 합니다. 예를 들어 추가해야 하는 것이 있다면 |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 17:40}} |
	  | some different color tweaks like correcting the image a little bit. | 약간 이미지를 교정하는 것과 같은 다양한 색상 조정을 수행합니다. |
	  | So we don't have that much grain in the highs and lows and you can also add some noise reduction in case you're experiencing some grain. | 그래서 저음과 고음에서 많은 노이즈가 나타나지 않도록 하며, 필요하다면 일부 노이즈 감소를 추가할 수도 있습니다. |
	  | But the key is bright conditions. | 하지만 키포인트는 밝은 조건입니다. |
	  | As long as you record in bright conditions, you're going to have a perfect result with your Igs. | 밝은 조건에서 녹화한다면 Igs로 완벽한 결과를 얻게 될 것입니다. |
	  | Now the X3 is not only a 360 camera it's a creative tool to enhance your videos, to give your videos a different perspective and to add the extra spice on your next | 이제 X3는 단순히 360 카메라가 아니라 비디오를 향상시키는 창의적인 도구입니다. 비디오에 다른 시각을 제공하고 다음 비디오에 추가 매력을 더할 수 있습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 18:09}} |
	  | trip. And that's why I love the X3 so much. It's such a versatile camera and has a solar crater so easy to capture the shots that I would normally need my wife to come with me to capture. Now I can do all of that with the, and it's such a versatile and a must have camera in addition to your current setup. And with the three meter invisible selfish stick, you know, you can capture some really amazing | 여행. 그래서 나는 X3를 그렇게 좋아한다. 그것은 정말 다재다능한 카메라이며 태양 크레이터가 있어 내가 보통 아내가 같이 와야 하는 촬영을 쉽게 촬영할 수 있다. 그제서야 나는 그 모든 것을 할 수 있으며 현재 설정에 추가로 꼭 필요한 카메라이다. 그리고 무선 셀카봉 때문에 정말 놀라운 것들을 촬영할 수 있다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 18:34}} |
	  | shots. You can do some fake drawn shots which you can actually reframe to look a little bit cooler than maybe just a static cinema, a drone shot. | 샷을. 당신은 실제로 프레임을 재구성하여 조금 더 쿨하게 보일 수 있는 가짜 그림촬영을 할 수 있습니다. |
	  | Like I said if you have the perfect conditions, perfect bright conditions, it's going to look awesome anyway. | 내가 말한대로 완벽한 조건, 완벽한 밝은 조건이 있다면, 아무튼 멋질 것이다. |
	  | And you can really create some amazing things with this which I'm also coming back to in one of the next videos with the X3 creative shot list. | 그리고 당신은 이것으로 정말 멋진 것들을 만들어낼 수 있습니다. X3 창작 촬영 목록 중 하나의 다음 비디오에서 다시 다루고 있습니다. |
	  | If you don't have the three meter invisible selfish stick I highly recommend that you | 3미터의 보이지 않는 이기적인 막대가 없다면 강력히 추천합니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 19:04}} |
	  | grab this because this is the difference between creating unique shots with the X3 and not. | 이것을 잡으세요. 이것은 X3로 독특한 촬영을 하는 것과 그렇지 않은 것의 차이입니다. |
	  | So let me know what you think of the INSTA 360x3. | 그래서 INSTA 360x3에 대해 어떻게 생각하는지 알려주세요. |
	  | Do you have it already or will you be getting it before the summer holidays? | 이미 가지고 계신가요, 아니면 여름 휴가 전에 구입할 예정인가요? |
	  | I'm really excited to bring this to Hawaii. | 이것을 하와이에 가져가는 것이 정말 기대돼요. |
	  | We are going to Hawaii again soon so I can't wait to bring the X3 with my good old install 360 Go two. | 우리는 곧 다시 하와이로 가기 때문에 X3와 제 오랜 친구 인스타 360 고2를 가져가는 것이 너무 기대돼요. |
	  | Hopefully we can see a goal three soon | 희망차례로 골 3를 곧 볼 수 있으면 좋겠습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 19:33}} |
	  | and that would be really amazing. | 그건 정말 놀라울 것이다. |
	  | I love this go to so much and I love the versatility of the 360, the X3 camera and it's a must have if you ask me. | 나는 이것을 너무 좋아하고 360, X3 카메라의 다양성을 사랑합니다. 그리고 이것은 필수품이에요. |
	  | So there will be some links down to that in the description bow if you want to check it out also the accessories that I used with the Instar 360 X3. | 따라서 설명란에 그에 대한 링크가 있을 것이며, 그것을 확인하고 싶다면 또한 Instar 360 X3와 함께 사용한 악세사리도 있을 것입니다. |
	  | Now if you found any value in this video, let me know by dropping a light down below. | 이 비디오에서 어떤 가치를 찾았다면, 아래에 좋아요를 눌러 알려주세요. |

And then I said, right, this is the time to go freelance. so. But also I didn't even study graphic design in university. I did marketing and sociology. So it's been a big journey from there to becoming a freelance designer. And how did you how did you learn to be a graphic designer? Did you do any courses? Yes I did amazing courses. Which I really recommend for anyone who wants to become a designer who doesn't have a degree.It's a three month portfolio course and it's called Shillington Education and there's one in London, one in New York, one in a few in Australia, and it's a three month intensive portfolio course that you've got all the skills you need to build a portfolio ready to start looking for your first graphic design job as a junior.And then you build from there. All jewelry clients. Jewelry brands that I work for, yes mostly jewelry What do you do? Do you create the jewelry itself? Do you create the social media graphics? Yeah. So basically think of anything that a brand might need for selling their product. So they might need like website banners to be updated.Like look books, they'll need product line sheets. They might need to rebrand. Yeah, they'll need their newsletters designed and sent out. So I do a lot of this. Let's say you're doing a competition. You need text on an image and make it look really cool. I'm lucky that I have mostly the same clients for the past three years.That we work together in a really nice way and we have like a nice relationship. So I sometimes I find new clients just through word of mouth, from recommendations from friends. But mostly it is from the very first year that I got my clients and I just kept them. So I charge a day rate for my clients and then I build just at the end of the month or hours, it just depends on the project.I'm really, really flexible. I'm like whatever  suits my clients or I'm cool with anything, Where did it come your idea to become a digital nomads. From working in Greece for that first year. I saw it was really possible to live this life to work remotely. Yeah. Like I've never even met my clients in real life, but they're totally fine with that because at the time it just was so normal to work remotely anyway.And then I just sort of got addicted to that feeling of, of being able to continue on like a normal life, but just to be in totally different environments like every couple of months. And why did you choose Brazil this time? Well, I chose Brazil because shout out to my friend Harriet. She brought me here last year for the first time because she came for a Selina retreat experience and she loved it.And then she said, We got to go. And she brought me with her. And this time last year and I just went because she said it was amazing. I didn't really know much about. Here in Floripa? Here in Floripa. Exactly. And so, this year Harriet couldn't come this time. But I said, okay, I'm going to go anyway myself.And I have a few friends from last year, so I'm reconnecting with them, but also making new friends. One last question Just if you feel comfortable sharing, how much money do you usually make per month? I make about £6,000 a month. Yeah. Great. It’s pretty good. So, yeah, I feel very grateful that I'm able to make that money.And just to live. To live life is like this. So I feel very grateful. Oh, yeah. Well, thank you so much for sharing your story.

	  | After my first series interviewing digital nomads in Bali getting to know several ways of how to make money online and receiving thousands of comments with questions about this community I decided to start a new season of interviews to ask them all we want to know. | 바리에서 디지털 노마드를 인터뷰한 첫 시리즈를 마치며 온라인으로 돈을 벌 방법을 알아가고 이 커뮤니티에 대한 수천 개의 질문을 받았습니다. 이제 우리가 알고 싶어하는 모든 것을 물어보기 위해 새로운 인터뷰 시즌을 시작하기로 결정했습니다. | 
	  | This time I'm on a remote island in the south of Brazil and it's called Florianopolis. This island is becoming the new digital nomad hub. | 이번에는 브라질 남부의 한 원격 섬에 있습니다. 이 곳은 플로리아노폴리스(Florianopolis)라고 합니다. 이 섬은 새로운 디지털 노매드 허브가 되고 있습니다. |
	  | because of its tropical, beautiful beaches, the super clear water and you can also find people from all over the world. | 열대의 아름다운 해변때문에 맑고 깊은 바다, 전 세계의 사람들을 만날 수 있습니다. |
	  | The place that I chose today for the interviews is this hostel called Selina. | 오늘 인터뷰를 위해 내가 선택한 장소는 Selina라는 호스텔입니다. |
	  | It's a corking hostel right in front of that beach that I was. | 나가 있던 해변 바로 앞에 멋진 호스텔이 있습니다. |
	  | There are many digital moments here. | 여기에는 많은 디지털 순간들이 있습니다. |
	  | This is the swimming pool. | 이것은 수영장입니다. |
	  | This is the area that they stay and they also have a co-working space right there | 이곳은 그들이 머무르는 공간이자 코워킹 공간도 있습니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 00:47}} |
	  | but it's full of digital noms and I'm super excited to ask them all the questions. | 그러나 디지털 콘텐츠로 가득 차 있고 모든 질문을 하기 위해 매우 흥분하고 있습니다. |
	  | So let's go and get into it. | 그러니 출발해서 이야기에 들어가 보죠. |
	  | What's your name and where are you from? | 당신의 이름은 무엇이며 어디 출신이십니까? |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 00:58}} |
	  | I'm from TEL Aviv, Israel. | 저는 이스라엘의 텔 아비브 출신입니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 01:02}} |
	  | Are you living here in Brazil or just working? | 브라질에 살고 있나요 아니면 일하고만 있나요? |
	  | Do you work remotely? | 원격으로 일하시나요? |
	  | I work remotely I travel in South America for around four months. | 저는 원격으로 일하고 남미를 약 4개월간 여행했습니다. |
	  | I'm out here in Florenapolis having a great time. | 저는 현재 플로렌아폴리스에 있어 좋은 시간을 보내고 있습니다. |
	  | Stand just came out. So yeah, no | 새로운 제품이 나왔습니다. 네, 맞아요 |
	-
	- | | 
	  | I work for a company called Charge Flow that is an ecommerce app that helps ecommerce merchants automate chargebacks. | Charge Flow라는 회사에서 일합니다. 이 회사는 전자상거래 상인들이 차지백을 자동화하는 전자상거래 앱입니다. |
	  | Do you know what chargebacks are? Charge bucks? It's when let's say I'm a business and you're a client and you bought something for me and then a month later you would come to me like you would say to the bank hey, I haven't done this order or defrauded me on this. | 차지백이 무엇인지 아십니까? 차지벅스? 예를 들어, 제가 사업을 하고 있고 당신이 클라이언트인 경우 제품을 구입하셨다고 가정해봅시다. 그리고 한 달 후에 당신이 제게 와서, 은행에 하듯이, "이 주문을 하지 않았다거나 속이거나 했다"고 말할 때입니다. |
	  | So you would go to the bank and file a charge against me like you would sue me some way and I would have to handle this and it became like a very headache for a lot of businesses, you know, especially in E commerce and that hurts their revenue. | 그래서 당신은 은행에 가서 제게 고소를 걸거나 어떤 식으로든 소송을 걸어야 하는데, 그것을 다뤄야 하는 힘이 듭니다. 특히 전자 상거래 분야에서 수많은 비즈니스에게는 매우 머리아픈 일이 되며 그들의 수익에도 영향을 미칩니다. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 01:55}} |
	  | So we helped them automate that I'm getting paid as a freelancer kind of, you know, to that company I only work for them. | 지금 난 그들이 하는 일을 자동화하는 데 도와줬어. 난 프리랜서로 돈을 받아, 그 회사에 근무하고 있어. |
	  | Now you know, I was thinking of opening an agency because what I do I do like marketing on social media actually Twitter, LinkedIn and influencer marketing. | 지금 너는 알게 된 거야, 나 지금 말로하는 걸 해. 소셜 미디어에서 진짜 트위터나 링크드인 가지고, 인플루언서 마케팅도 해. |
	  | I worked with influencers to help them promote the company. I was thinking of opening an agency last year but I decided to just stick to one company. | 나는 인플루언서들과 함께 일해서 그들이 회사를 홍보하는 데 도와줬어. 작년에 에이전시를 열 생각까지 했는데, 결국 한 회사에만 전념하기로 결정했어. |
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 02:19}} |
	  | and then maybe in the future it'll be | 그리고 아마도 미래에는 |
	  | {{youtube-timestamp 02:21}} |
	  | because I found now like, you know, the balance between working and traveling my goal is to continue progress with my work while enjoying life. | 지금 비슷한 느낌이 들어요, 아시죠, 일하고 여행하며 잘 조화를 맞춘 지금 나의 목표는 일을 진행하면서 삶을 즐기는 것입니다. |
	  | You know, I don't want to be Florianapolis and everyone's outside. | 아시다시피, 나는 Florianapolis에 있다는 것을 원하지 않아. 모두가 밖에 있는데. |
	  | This is happening right now. | 이게 지금 일어나고 있어. |
	  | It's like major formal like I used to believe that I should make it early and then I'm going to retire and go to Brazil. | 이건 제가 예전에 믿어왔던 것과 처럼 큰 검토입니다. 일찍 이루면서 미래에는 은퇴하고 브라질로 가겠다고 생각했었는데. |
	  | But then I realized | 그런데 그러다가 깨달았죠 |
	- Rafa 02:41
	  we're going to be too old to enjoy the, we need to enjoy it when we are still young.
	- Ori 02:48
	  Exactly. Yeah so then I decided to switch it and I said, okay, maybe I could like, maybe these ambitious projects would wait for me.
	  In the meantime I could just find a sustainable income travel a bit because who knows what's going to happen tomorrow you know, the world is crazy, a lot of hectic shit going on and especially where I'm from.
	  So that's cool. It is what it is you know, free of hostages and ceasefire.
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 02:41}} |
	  | we're going to be too old to enjoy the, we need to enjoy it when we are still young. | 우리는 즐기기에 너무 나이가 많을 것이다. 젊을 때 즐기는 법을 배워야지. |  
	  | {{youtube-timestamp 02:48}} |
	  | Exactly. Yeah so then I decided to switch it and I said, okay, maybe I could like, maybe these ambitious projects would wait for me. In the meantime I could just find a sustainable income travel a bit because who knows what's going to happen tomorrow you know, the world is crazy, a lot of hectic shit going on and especially where I'm from. So that's cool. It is what it is you know, free of hostages and ceasefire. | 정확히. 그래서 나는 방향을 전환하기로 결정했다. 혹시, 이 산만한 프로젝트들이 나를 기다리고 있을지도 몰라. 그동안 내가 지속적인 수입을 창출하고, 또 여행도 좀 해봐야겠다. 왜냐하면 내일 무슨 일이 벌어질 지 아무도 모르잖아. 세계는 미친 듯이 돌아가고, 특히 내가 있는 곳은 그저 그런 일들이 많이 벌어지고 있으니까. 그래서 괜찮아. 어떻게든 될 거니까, 인질과 휴전 없이 그저 |
	- Ori 03:12
	  Now that made me come to realization to enjoy the moment the moment.
	  Yes and just to have fun
	- | {{youtube-timestamp 03:19}} |
	  | are you always doing something related to E commerce and social media or did you change something to do what you're doing? | 항상 전자 상거래 및 소셜 미디어와 관련된 일을 하고 있나요, 아니면 지금 하는 일을 하기 위해 무언가를 변경했나요? | 
	  | Now | 지금 |
	  | I changed rapidly working as a PPC manager. | 빠르게 변경했습니다. PPC 매니저로 일하며. |
	  | It's like paper click like paid campaigns on Facebook and stuff like that. | 페이퍼클릭과 같아요, 페이스북에서의 유료 캠페인과 그런 것들. |
	  | And I learned it's a digital course so I never went to university or something like that. | 그리고 배웠는데, 디지털 코스라서 대학에 다니지 않았거나 그런 거예요. |
	  | I had my own startup. I built a website that celebrities can register and people can buy birthday videos from them. Videos in general | 제 자신의 스타트업이 있었어요. 유명인들이 등록할 수 있는 웹사이트를 만들었고 사람들이 그들로부터 생일 비디오를 구매할 수 있어요. 일반적으로 비디오. |
	- Rafa 03:50
	  kind of video sorry like them saying happy birthday
	- Ori 03:52
	  yeah say one like Nimar or have your young sisters say happy birthday.
	  Oh, that's so interesting.
	  Yeah they have a version like this is very popular in America.
	  It's called Kamo. My first job that I got remotely it started off as a upward gig.
	  I started working for them and then I became like head of social media but I ended up switching to another to the company I work for now.
	  So yeah it's definitely like kind of making something out of nothing in a very informal way.
	- Rafa 04:24
	  One last question if you want to share with us, how much money do you make per month?
	  Usually
	- Ori 04:30
	  I wouldn't feel so comfortable saying this like I don't want the tax authorities would come to me and be like, you know, just kidding, I pay taxes but I would say enough enough to make a living to have the freedom to the way I want to live and eat outside.
	  And if I want to like sometime I want a private room instead of dorms I can do this.
	  You know,
	- Rafa 04:58
	  it's a comfortable life you'd
	- Ori 05:00
	  it's comfortable.
	- Rafa 05:01
	  Nice. Thank you so much. She was lovely talking to you and I hope you enjoyed Flori.
	- Ori 05:05
	  Thank you Ralph I will
	- 참석자 3 05:09
	  My name is Ashling. Where are you from?
	  I'm from Dublin, from Ireland.
	- Rafa 05:13
	  What do you do that likes you work remotely?
	  What kind of job is that?
	- 참석자 3 05:17
	  So I'm a graphic designer and I do freelance so it's perfect because it's totally my own schedule and total freedom and I can pick how many days I want to work for a client and that means I can use extra days I have during the week to travel.
	- Rafa 05:33
	  Were you always a graphic designer?
	  Did you change something to become a digital nomad?
	  What's your ST?
	- 참석자 3 05:38
	  Actually I've been a graphic designer full time in London and for 6 or 7 years very much just commuting working like sort of rat race London life.
	  And then once the pandemic started I decided to make a change and I wanted to do some volunteering in Greece.
	  That's what brought me to Greece where it started and then yeah, then the volunteering ended and then I said right this is the time to go freelance now.
	- 참석자 3 06:04
	  But also I didn't even study graphic design at university.
	  I did marketing and sociology.
	  So it's been a big journey from there to becoming a freelance designer.
	- Rafa 06:13
	  And how did you learn to be a graphic designer?
	  Did you do any courses?
	- 참석자 3 06:18
	  Yes I did an amazing course which I really recommend for anyone who wants to become a designer who doesn't have a degree.
	  It's a three month portfolio course and it's called Shillington Education.
	  And there's one in London, one in New York, one in with you in Australia and it's a three month intensive portfolio course that
	- 참석자 3 06:34
	  you've got all the skills you need to build a portfolio ready to start looking for your first graphic design job as a junior and then you build from there all Jeul clients, Jul brands that you work for Yes Mostly
	- Rafa 06:46
	  what do you do? Do you create the jewelry itself?
	  Do you create the social media graphics?
	- 참석자 3 06:51
	  Yeah so basically think of anything that a brand might need for selling their products.
	  So they might need like website banners to be updated.
	  They'll need like look books they'll need product line sheets they might need a rebrand they'll need their newsletters designed and sent out.
	  I do all of this
	- 참석자 3 07:08
	  that's you're doing a competition.
	  You need text on an image and make it look really cool and do all that.
	  I'm lucky that I have mostly the same clients for the past three years that we work together in a really nice way and we have like a nice relationship.
	  So sometimes I find new clients just through word of mouth, from recommendations from friends but mostly it is from the very first year that I got my clients and
	- 참석자 3 07:31
	  them. So I charge a day rate for my clients and then I bill just at the end of the month or hours.
	  It just depends on the project.
	  I'm really, really flexible and like whatever suits my clients or I'm cool with anything.
	  Really
	- Rafa 07:42
	  I did it become your idea to become a Digudo noman
	- 참석자 3 07:45
	  from working in Greece for that first year I saw it was really possible to live this life to work remotely like I've never even met my clients in real life but they're totally fine with that because at the time it just was so normal to work remotely anyway.
	  And then I just sort of got addicted to that feeling of being able to continue on like a normal life but just to be in totally different environments like every couple of months.
	- Rafa 08:09
	  Did you choose Brazil this time?
	- 참석자 3 08:11
	  Wow, I chose Brazil because a shadow to my friend Harriet she brought me here last year first time because she came for a Selina retreat experience and she loved it and then she said we gotta go so she brought me with her and this time last year and I just went because she said it was amazing.

	- Rafa 11:47
	  and where are you from?
	- 참석자 5 11:48
	  I'm actually from Curitiba but I started my digital nomad life actually working for other corporate companies in the past.
	  And right now I just decided to quit everything and decided to be like a content creator and I also keep traveling.
	- Rafa 12:02
	  Oh so it's very recent. Your lifestyle as an omed or were you doing it before?
	  What's your story?
	- 참석자 5 12:10
	  Okay so I actually started on the startup world five years ago actually found myself as a product manager and then I started to develop my career into that.
	  But at one time in my life I decided, okay I don't want to work to anyone anymore.
	  I wanted to create my own company and some people on LinkedIn they invited me to create a company like insurance company.
	  I enjoined the company help them to build from zero day company to 120 clients I think.
	- 참석자 5 12:38
	  And but then I realized that I was actually working a lot like too too much.
	  I was working from 2, 12 hours to 14 hours a day.
	  Wow and then I got like a really heavy burnout and I said to myself okay I cannot have this life anymore like life is not just working it's also like sleeping a little bit more.
	- 참석자 5 13:00
	  So I decided to, okay, let's try to get another work that is fully remote and I can get paid in dollars.
	  It was pretty great. I was been able to travel a lot but then I got burned out again and I said, okay, that's enough for me.
	  I don't want to work in the corporate job.
	- Rafa 13:17
	  I understand I had to quit my job as well to start a new life and I totally understand.
	- 참석자 5 13:24
	  So right now I'm building content creation about lifestyle trying to convince people to actually quit their jobs and their
	- Rafa 13:33
	  what, what's your handle?
	- 참석자 5 13:35
	  Yeah so it's a curot to Camoto under
	- Rafa 13:37
	  also follow him and follow his journey.
	- 참석자 5 13:40
	  Only three weeks since I quit my job.
	  And like Floripo is a place that I love to go like here we can find like a lot of you can.
	  It's really easy to meet a lot of people in here and to make new friends especially like people from all around the wor.
	- Rafa 13:54
	  Was it hard for you to do the transition between a corporate job to content creation?
	  Was it difficult for you and for your family?
	- 참석자 5 14:05
	  My family doesn't know anything about it actually
	- Rafa 14:08
	  you're going to discover now
	- 참석자 5 14:11
	  mom and dad if you're watching this like,
	- Rafa 14:13
	  you know you quit
	- 참석자 5 14:14
	  they don't know they have no idea.
	- Rafa 14:16
	  Oh, okay
	- 참석자 5 14:17
	  they have no idea because like when I quit the corporate job and like was going to build my own startup, they already got really upset with me and that also happened when I quit university.
	  Yeah I didn't like I tried three units and really yeah and it didn't work out like it wasn't for me and creative Yes they got like really fuck and upset with me.
	  So like this one, I'm just going to tell like after like I started to make a lot of money in it and they'll be safe.
	- Rafa 14:46
	  Okay do you have any future plans for your content creation?
	  What are your goals with that?
	- 참석자 5 14:53
	  I think my main go with that is I realize that because when I was building my own company I know that I was a really workaholic person.
	  But after the burnouts I understood that like, okay, that's not living at all like you need to enjoy other things.
	  So I think my main objective of living is like just to get to know more people and understand like try to get my curiosity like all inside my head to outside of the world.
	- 참석자 5 15:23
	  Do my personal objective with my content creation all there's much more things to do besides work.
	  And here are the interesting things that you can learn about.
	- Rafa 15:33
	  And one last question just if you want to share how much money do you make per month as a content creator?
	- 참석자 5 15:39
	  Sure okay as a content creator I'm actually making zero money right now
	- Rafa 15:44
