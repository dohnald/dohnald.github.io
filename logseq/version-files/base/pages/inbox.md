  collapsed:: true
  * ((658050ce-ac71-4664-a7ef-f440ead9050b))
	- 전문가들은 대체로 횡재세를 두고 '요점을 잘못 짚은 방안'이라고 지적했다. 고금리 시대에서 과점을 형성한 은행권 구조나 높은 변동금리 비중을 낮춰야 문제가 해결될 일이라고 봤다. 또 서민의 이자 부담은 '상생금융으로 풀어야 할 문제'라고 주장했다.
	- [[강성진]] 고려대 경제학과 교수 "예대금리 격차는 우리나라 금융시장의 비정상적 형태에서 나오는 것" "금융기관 간 경쟁 강화를 통해 초과 이윤이 감소하도록 만드는 것이 좋은데 지금은 일시적 이득에 세금을 물리려고 한다" "독과점에 의해 경쟁 구도 자체가 없어서 나타난 현상인데 마치 나쁜 일을 한 것처럼 벌금을 물리는 것은 바람직하지 않다" "일시적 소득 증가에 세금을 부과한다면 반대로 일시적 손해를 볼 때 세금을 줄여줄 것인가에 대한 문제도 있다" "금융기관들이 ESG경영 차원에서 지원을 하도록 유도해야 한다"
	- [[양준모]] 연세대 경제학과 교수 "횡재세는 보호받아야 할 재산권에 소급입법을 하자는 건데, 그 자체가 위헌 소지가 있다" "은행이 20~30년짜리 장기 채권을 발행해 이와 연계해 상품을 설계하면 대부분 고정금리로 묶어둘 수 있고 금리가 뛰더라도 변동폭이 없어진다" "지금은 고정-변동금리 간 격차가 심해 다들 변동금리를 원하고 있다" "채권시장에서 국고채 점유 비중을 낮추고 금융기관의 장기채권 발행을 활성화하는 제도 개선이 필요하다" "금융시스템 개혁을 고민해야 답을 찾을 수 있다"고 강조했다.

  title:: '공매도 전산화' 3년 만에 재논의. 이번엔 도입될까
  collapsed:: true
	- 그간 불법 무차입 공매도가 금융당국의 감시를 피해 지속적으로 이뤄졌던 원인으로 '전산화 시스템의 미비'가 꼽힌다. 지금까지 국내 주식시장에서 공매도는 전산화되지 않아 모든 거래 기록을 수기로 관리하고 있었다. 이 때문에 기관끼리 대차거래 시 실수가 발생할 가능성이 높고 중간에서 불법 거래가 일어날 수도 있다. 가장 큰 문제는 실시간으로 공매도를 감시할 수 없어 오류가 발생해도 사전에 대응할 수 없다는 점이다.
	- 2020년에도 은성수 전 금융위원장은 무차입 공매도 실시간 모니터링 시스템 구축 계획을 밝혔지만 이듬해 포기를 공식화했다. 당시 은 전 위원장은 "비용이 천문학적으로 드는 데다 너무 많은 정보를 처리하게 되면 주식거래 체결이 늦어지고 시스템 과부하가 발생할 수 있다"고 이유를 밝혔다.
	- 김주현 금융위원장은 지난 10월 국정감사에서 "외국인 투자가 중요한 나라에서 외국에서 아무도 안 하는 이런 복잡하고 어려운 시스템을 만들어서 거래를 어렵게 만드는 게 과연 개인 투자자를 보호하는 정책인지 정말 자신이 없다"고 말하기도 했다. 
	  그러나 글로벌 IB의 무차입 공매도 사실이 드러나면서 정부가 먼저 칼을 빼 들자 금융당국도 입장을 바꾸고 시스템 구축에 나선 것으로 해석된다.
	- 전문가들과 투자자들은 회의적인 시선으로 보내고 있는 상황이다. 주식을 빌리는 목적과 사용하는 플랫폼이 모두 다른데 이를 실시간으로 파악하기란 기술적으로 불가능한 영역이라는 것이다.
- 국내 은행주의 저평가 이유에 대해 정부의 개입을 꼽는다. 은행 대상의 횡재세 이슈를 함께 보면 타당하다. 정부 개입 없는 산업이 없겠지만 라이센스를 통한 해자를 만들었기에 개입하는 게 당연하다는 입장도 있겠다.

	- 증시는 왜 한국 4대 금융지주사에 대해 이처럼 혹독한 평가를 할까?
	  바로 과도한 정부 간섭 때문이다. 경영의 초점을 연임에 맞추는 금융지주사 수뇌부, 구조적인 내수 침체, 핀테크사와의 경쟁도 모두 악재다.
	- 은행업은 미래가 불투명하다. 비용은 여전히 높고 경쟁이 심해 가격결정권도 없다. 카카오뱅크, 네이버파이낸셜같은 핀테크사에 시장을 계속 잠식당할 것이다. 적자 지점을 닫고 싶어도 감독 당국이 승인해주지 않아 방대한 지점 네트워크를 끌고 가야 하는 국내 은행의 주식을 장기 투자자는 매수할 이유가 없다.
- 라이센스는 최소한의 기준을 보장한다는 의미다. 라이센스로 기득권을 가지려고 하면 안 되는데 라이센스 업무들이 이런 것들을 취하려고 하는 문제가 점점 드러난다. 택시, 변호사, 의사…. 곧 다른 라이센스 문제도 나올 것이다. 플랫폼은 플랫폼으로 신뢰를 제공했고 이를 수용하는 것은 사용자들이 할 일이다. 더해서 카카오는 이 신뢰를 제대로 주지 못하고 있다.

  * 내가 피해자라고 호소하면 피해자가 되는 게 맞을까. 손실은 손실대로, 피해자는 그에 맞게 족집게 대응을 할 필요가 있다.
	- ELS는 중위험에 중수익을 기대할 수 있는 대표적인 금융자산으로 인식돼 왔다. 기초자산의 주가가 일정 범위 내에서 움직일 경우 약속된 조기상환 스케줄에 맞춰 연 5~7% 수준의 수익률을 확보할 수 있는 구조다. ^^하지만 본질적으로 ELS는 만기가 있고 변동성이 커질 경우 큰 손실을 볼 수밖에 없는 고위험 파생상품이다.^^ 그렇기 때문에 미국, 유럽 등 ^^금융 선진국에서는 일반 투자자들을 대상으로 ELS 같은 구조의 상품을 판매하지 않는다.^^ 특정 기업의 주가나 주가지수가 어느 수준을 넘어서 하락할 경우 원금 손실(녹인•knock-in) 위험에 직면하게 되고, 최악의 경우 투자금 전부를 손해 볼 수 있다.
	- 금융사고로부터 금융 소비자를 보호하는 조치는 분명 중요하다. 다만 투자상품에 대해 ^^손실이 발생할 때마다 배상 조치가 이뤄지고 금융회사에 과도한 책임이 부여되는 것 또한 문제가 된다.^^ 투자자들은 의사 결정과정에서 자신의 위험 성향에 맞는 금융상품을 선택하고 구조를 명확하게 이해해야 할 필요가 있다. 하지만 ^^손실이 발생해도 이의를 제기하면 보상을 받을 수 있다는 도덕적 해이가 확산할 경우, 금융회사들은 적절한 투자 상품을 공급할 유인을 찾지 못하게 된다^^. 이 는 궁극적으로 건전한 투자 문화의 발전을 저해하는 요소다.
	- ELS 사태와 상생금융의 전개 방향은 현재 국내 금융기관이 처한 현실의 단면을 보여준다. ^^주식시장에 상장돼 있는 민간 기업이지만 사회적 역할이 강조되고, 때로는 정치적 논리에서도 자유롭지 못한 공공기관의 성격을 지니고 있다.^^
	- 금융기관의 잘못도 크지만, 그렇다고 정부가 민간 영역에 지나치게 개입해서도 안 된다. ^^자영업자나 ELS 투자자의 실패 원인 역시 스스로 선택한 결과라는 걸 받아들여야 한다. 실패할 자유는 자유가 아니라는 정책은 자본주의를 병들게 한다.^^ 책임 없는 선택은 계약의 신뢰도를 파괴한다. 의도가 선하다고, 결과가 그러한 것은 아니다.

	- 이제는 전 세계가 물가가 아니라 더 깊은 불황을 우려하는 상황이 됐다. 게다가 한국과 같은 중소 경제 국가들은 자국 통화가치의 방어를 위해서 미국 금리를 따라 올려야만 되는 상황에 처했고, 이는 불황의 늪을 더 깊게 만드는 양상으로 이어지고 있다.

  title:: "중간배당 줘" 자회사에 손 벌린 한전 시끌시끌
	- 한전이 유례없는 중간배당 요구에 나선 것은 재무위기 악화로 ^^내년 한전채 한도가 대폭 줄어 한전채 신규 발행이 불가능해질 것을 우려해서^^. 한국전력공사법에 따라 한전은 원칙적으로 '자본금+ 적립금'의 5배까지 한전채를 발행할 수 있다. 올해는 지난해 말 기준으로 자본금과 적립금 합계(20조9200억원)의 5배인 104조6000억원까지 한전채를 발행할 수 있었다. 하지만 내년에는 상황이 달라진다. 전망치대로 올해 6조원대 영업손실을 내면 '자본금+적립금'이 14조9000억원으로 줄어든다. 이를 바탕으로 계산한 한전채 발행 한도는 74조5000 억원이다. 현재 한전채 발행 잔액은 79조6000억원 수준인데, 현재 전망대로라면 ^^내년 3월 결산 후 한전채 발행 한도가 초과해 한전은 한전채를 새로 찍어내지 못한다.^^ 신규 발행은커녕 5조원가량 기존 한전채부터 상환해야 한다. 기존처럼 한전채를 발행해 빚을 갚고 전기 구매, 송변전 시설 유지 보수 등에 쓰일 ^^자금을 융통할 수 없는 초유의 위기 상황에 직면할 수 있다는 의미^^다.
	- 한전의 자회사 중간배당 요구를 두고 배임 논란도 거세다. 발전 자회사 중 한 곳인 한국수력원자력은 올 들어 3분기까지 1600억원 영업손실 을 냈다. 그만큼 경영 여건이 어렵다는 의미다. 재계에서는 상법상 연 간 영업이익을 넘는 수준의 중간배당은 배임 소지가 있다는 우려가 나 온다. 재계 관계자는 "한전 사정이 어렵기는 하지만 ^^모기업 재무 부담을 자회사에 넘기는 만큼 '아랫돌 빼 윗돌 괴기' 조치라는 비난^^을 피할 수 없게 됐다"고 귀띔했다.

	- 카카오모빌리티는 지금도 수익성이 썩 높은 기업은 아니다. 기존 수수료 정책에서도 간신히 흑자를 내는 수준이었다.

		- **Ramses Oudt** {{youtube-timestamp 00:00}}
		  Welcome everyone my name is Ramses Oudt.
		  I am community manager at Logseq.
		  Today I am joined by Cara Antonaccio, who is a PHD student in the public health field.
		  Today we're talking about using Logseq for research, but not just for academic research, but basically any type of research.
		  So if you take notes, if you read papers and take notes on those papers, if you have any insights you need to gather and then later share in written form, Logseq is a perfect companion also because you can really let structure emerge on a day to day basis you can chip away at your research project.
		  And today Cara is joining us to talk about her workflow.
			- **Ramses Oudt** {{youtube-timestamp 00:00}}
			  안녕하세요 여러분, 제 이름은 람세스 오드트입니다.
			  저는 Logseq의 커뮤니티 매니저입니다.
			  오늘은 카라 안토나치오 선생님과 함께합니다. 그는 공중보건 분야의 박사과정 학생입니다.
			  오늘은 Logseq를 연구에 활용하는 방법에 대해 이야기할 것입니다. 학문적 연구뿐만 아니라 어떤 유형의 연구든지 가능합니다.
			  그래서 노트를 작성하거나 논문을 읽고 그에 대한 노트를 작성하거나, 필요한 통찰력을 모으고 나중에 글 형태로 공유해야 한다면, Logseq는 완벽한 동반자입니다. 일상적으로 구조가 점진적으로 형성되게 할 수 있고, 연구 프로젝트에 착수할 수 있습니다.
			  오늘은 카라가 그녀의 작업 흐름에 대해 이야기하기 위해 함께합니다.
		- **Ramses Oudt** {{youtube-timestamp 00:48}} 
		  This session is part of a series that I'm running hopefully far into the future called Workflow Wednesday It's a little bit of a cheesy title, but every week, basically every Wednesday, I want to invite one member from the Logseq community to share their workflow basically.
		  So we get to peek into the real world scenario of applying Logseq to real life problems.
			- 라름세스 오우트 {{youtube-timestamp 00:48}} 
			  이 세션은 향후로도 계속되기를 희망하는 시리즈의 일부입니다. Workflow Wednesday라는 약간 추잡한 이름을 가졌지만, 매주 수요일마다 Logseq 커뮤니티의 한 회원을 초대하여 그들의 워크플로우를 공유하고자 합니다.
			  그래서 우리는 Logseq를 실생활 문제에 적용하는 실제 상황을 엿볼 수 있습니다.
		- **Ramses Oudt** {{youtube-timestamp  01:10}}
		  So Kara, thank you for being here.
		  Today we're going to talk a little bit about your PPM(?) story, your use case, your journal, how you use the journal's page, how you do research using Logseq, what other tools you use and your top tips for people doing research using Logseq Take it away please introduce yourself.
			- **Ramses Oudt** {{youtube-timestamp  01:10}}
			  카라, 여기에 있어주셔서 감사합니다.
			  오늘은 당신의 PPM(?) 이야기, 사용 사례, 저널을 사용하는 방법, Logseq를 사용하여 연구하는 방법, 다른 도구들, 그리고 Logseq를 사용하여 연구를 하는 사람들을 위한 최상의 팁에 대해 조금 얘기해보려고 합니다. 자기소개 부탁드릴게요.
		- **Cara Antonaccio** {{youtube-timestamp 01:31}} 
		  great. Thanks. So hello everyone I'm super excited to be here and to share my experiences and what I've learned and how I use Logseq.
		  So I'll share my screen. I want to start off if everyone could just share how you do research, what you're researching I know everyone's sharing where they're from.
		  So if you could just pop in the chat, what topics you're interested in, whether it's professional research or just interests that you have in general.
			- **Cara Antonaccio** {{youtube-timestamp 01:31}} 
			  좋아요. 감사합니다. 여러분 안녕하세요. 저는 여기에 있어서 너무 기쁩니다. 제 경험과 배운 점, 그리고 저의 Logseq 사용법을 공유하려고 합니다.
			  그럼 화면을 공유하겠습니다. 우선 모두가 어떻게 연구를 진행하는지, 무슨 주제로 연구하고 계시는지 말씀해 주시기 바랍니다. 제가 아는 바로는 모두가 자신의 출신지를 공유하시고 계신 것 같은데요.
			  그러니까 채팅에 원하시는 주제나 관심사를 알려주시면 됩니다. 전문적인 연구이던 일반적인 관심사이던 상관 없습니다.
		- **Cara Antonaccio** {{youtube-timestamp 01:58}} 
		  So I can get an idea of what you might be thinking of using Logseq to research.
		  That would be awesome. And then if it's okay with you, Ramses, I'm going to go a little bit out of order.
		  So I always start each day in the journal.
		  So I figured I'd start there too.
		  Yes, I do everything from the journal.
		  It's sort of my base in the morning so I make sure that I detail you know, it really just helps me to get started with logging by just going through you know, aspects of my days.
		  So I have things that are going on in the morning but once I deal with that, I close off things that I need to take care of in my life and then my work schedule.
			- **Cara Antonaccio** {{youtube-timestamp 01:58}}
			  로그시크를 연구에 사용하려는 것에 대한 아이디어를 얻을 수 있을 것 같아요. 멋질 거에요. 그리고, Ramses, 괜찮다면, 순서를 조금 바꿀 거예요. 저는 항상 일지에서 하루를 시작해요. 그래서 거기에서도 시작하려고 생각한 거예요. 네, 제가 모든 것을 일지에서 처리해요. 아침에는 제 기준이 되는 토대이기 때문에, 일들의 다양한 측면을 점검하는 것으로 출근을 시작하는 데 도움이 되거든요. 아침에 진행해야 할 일들이 있지만, 그것들을 처리하고 나면, 제 인생에서 신경 써야 할 일들과 그 다음에는 제 업무 일정을 마무리해요.
		- **Cara Antonaccio** {{youtube-timestamp 02:40}} 
		  So I have a meeting at 9 o'clock about this project with these people and each, each item in my schedule sort of follows that same flow.
		  So I'm teaching at 10 about my workflow with Ramses so sort of just keeping a nice sort of flow like that.
		  So and then you go into my log and then each of the, each of the things that I'm working on during the day follows the same sort of what you call it convention where I'm searching about this from or related to this and this.
			- **Cara Antonaccio** {{youtube-timestamp 02:40}} 
			  9시에 이 프로젝트와 관련하여 이들과의 회의가 있는데, 제 스케줄에 있는 각 항목들이 해당 흐름을 따른다.
			  그래서 10시에라면 Ramses와의 워크플로우에 대해 가르칠 예정이므로 이러한 원활한 흐름을 유지하고 있습니다.
			  그리고 그런 다음 로그로 들어가면, 하루 종일 작업하는 각각의 항목이 이와 같은 일종의 관습을 따르는데, 이를 통해 이것에 대한 정보를 찾거나 이와 관련된 작업을 수행하고 있습니다.
		- **Cara Antonaccio** {{youtube-timestamp 03:10}} 
		  So sort of just laying it all out and then going into it in another page.
		  So these are just so where I'm keeping track of everything that I'm doing all the things that I need to do for the day, who I need to send things to and then you know, wrapping it all up.
			- **Cara Antonaccio** {{youtube-timestamp 03:10}} 
			  그래서 모든 것을 말하는 것이지요. 그리고 다른 페이지로 넘어가서 자세히 설명하겠습니다.
			  이것들은 그냥 제가 하루 동안 해야 할 모든 것들과 필요한 사람들에게 보내야 할 일들을 추적하고 있는 것뿐이에요. 그리고 마무리하겠다는 얘기입니다.
		- **Cara Antonaccio** {{youtube-timestamp 03:25}} 
		  So that's sort of just my general layout each day.
		  It varies day to day. Sometimes I might not have a schedule for the weekend for example.
		  And so that's what it looks like when I wake up in the morning and I'm trying to figure out what my day's going to look like.
		  This is what I end up with.
		  So now I'll go a little bit more into,
			- **Cara Antonaccio** {{youtube-timestamp 03:25}} 
			  그래서 그냥 내 매일 일반적인 레이아웃이에요.
			  날마다 다른 거예요. 가끔 주말에는 일정이 없을 수도 있어요.
			  그래서 아침에 일어나서 내일이 어떻게 될지를 알아보려고 할 때 이렇게 돼요.
			  제가 최종적으로 얻는 결과물이에요.
			  그래서 이제 좀 더 자세히 얘기해보겠습니다.
		- **Ramses Oudt** {{youtube-timestamp 03:41}} 
		  I'd like to summarize and also because obviously I am also an attendee basically and I'm just going to speak of what I'm observing.
		  First question can you make the text a little bit bigger? Can you zoom in? I'm on a small screen and I can imagine more people will be looking at a small screen.
		  I will be editing this a little bit later.
		  Yeah a little bit bigger would be good but yeah,
			- **Ramses Oudt** {{youtube-timestamp 03:41}} 
			  요약하고, 또한 저도 참석자이기 때문에 제가 관찰한 것에 대해 얘기하려고 합니다.
			  첫 번째 질문은 텍스트를 조금 크게 만들 수 있을까요? 확대할 수 있을까요? 제가 작은 화면을 사용하고 있고 다른 사람들도 작은 화면을 볼 것이라 상상할 수 있습니다.
			  나중에 이것을 조금 편집할 것입니다.
			  네, 조금 더 크면 좋을 것 같습니다. 그래도,
		- **Ramses Oudt** {{youtube-timestamp 04:06}} 
		  great great thank you. So basically first my observation is and I think many people missed this.
		  I think when they start out with Loxig or basically any other tool that has a journals or a daily notes page, is you dump everything that happens on a day or you're thinking about on the same page? But then the question is oh, now it's tagged with that date.
		  But how does it actually then work down the line? And what I see and you have a lot of nice CSS sprinkles over it but I see many links.
		  So when I look at your Logseq, I see I think search is a link mental health problems is a link conflict affected children they're all links.
			- **Ramses Oudt** {{youtube-timestamp 04:06}} 
			  좋아요 좋아요 감사합니다. 기본적으로 제 첫 관찰은 많은 사람들이 이를 놓친다고 생각합니다.
			  록시그 또는 기본적으로 일지 또는 일일 메모 페이지가 있는 다른 도구를 시작할 때 하루에 발생하는 모든 것이나 생각하는 모든 것을 동일한 페이지에 모아놓는다고 생각합니다. 그런데 그게 날짜와 함께 태그되는 것인데요.
			  하지만 실제로 어떻게 되는건가요? 그리고 제가 보는 바, 여러분은 다양한 멋진 CSS 스프링클을 가지고 있지만 많은 링크를 볼 수 있습니다.
			  여러분의 록시그를 살펴보면, 검색은 링크이고, 정신 건강 문제는 링크이고, 충돌에 영향받은 아이들은 모두 링크입니다.
		- **Ramses Oudt** {{youtube-timestamp 04:39}} 
		  So anything you, you write underneath is automatically linked with all those terms.
		  So that will in turn probably come in handy with queries or just when clicking through your notes.
		  But that is one observation.
		  I really want to emphasize how useful it is to work in this way just from your journal's page.
			- **Ramses Oudt** {{youtube-timestamp 04:39}} 
			  그래서 당신이 쓰는 어떤 것이라도 그 아래에는 자동으로 모든 용어와 연결됩니다.
			  그래서 그것은 아마도 질의나 메모를 클릭할 때 유용하게 사용될 것입니다.
			  하지만 이것은 하나의 관찰입니다.
			  저는 정말로 당신의 저널 페이지에서 작업하는 것이 얼마나 유용한지 강조하고 싶습니다.
		- Cara Antonaccio 05:09
		  Yeah and I have, I should have mentioned that.
		  So I really only touched on the structure of it.
		  But when you go into each line, each line starts with a process.
		  So meeting, teaching, going, practicing, searching they're all processes that I use in the log and that yet.
		  So each of these sort of headings has a process associated with it or a bunch of processes
		- Cara Antonaccio 05:33
		  and I'll discuss those specifically related to the research processes in a minute.
		  But like Reni said, they're all linked.
		  So if I go to search, I have a very short log of all the different topics that I've been searching.
		  But it keeps a running log of every time that I'm doing a certain thing.
		  It'll tell,
		- Cara Antonaccio 05:51
		  you know, when I did it and what I was working on.
		  I guess I'll move into my research workflow now.
		  So most of my research workflow happens in the log.
		  Sometimes it happens when I'm having meetings with collaborators it'll go on the schedule but typically it'll be in the log.
		  So I'm going to start from over on this side here.
		  So just a little bit of background about who I am, what I do research in and my experience.
		- Cara Antonaccio 06:14
		  I'm doing research in 2018 I got my Master of science in public health from Johns Hopkins.
		  I focused on population health.
		  So my training is really in population health and epidemiology and I'm currently a PHD candidate at Boston College expecting to graduate in June and I study armed conflict.
		  These are all links so it's
		- Cara Antonaccio 06:34
		  goes back to everything that I tag with these different things.
		  So armed conflict, health and human rights, mental health, and humanitarian assistance.
		  And to do this, I use algorithmic modeling as well as geographical statistics and these are some of the programs that I use to do these things.
		  So a little bit about how I got here.
		  So when I say here I mean logs.
		  So in February 201,
		- Cara Antonaccio 07:02
		  I was really looking for a planning and a research tool sort of like a dual planning and research tool, a dual literature review tool where I could sort of do everything in one program or application because I needed to write my dissertation proposal.
		  So I really felt like I, I have a lot going on in my brain.
		  It's all up there but I really needed to compartmentalize and process and integrate the knowledge that I was trying to dissertate about.
		  So
		- Cara Antonaccio 07:29
		  I tried a few different things some success and some shortcomings in certain areas.
		  So I tried Max QDA super strange.
		  Maxqda is a qualitative analysis software.
		  So the way that I used that was I uploaded all of the literature that I needed into Max QDA and I tried to code it as though it was like a qualitative analysis that was weird.
		  I didn't really like it. It didn't suit the needs I had for like integration and synthesis of ideas or really like
		- Cara Antonaccio 07:56
		  digging into the ideas themselves.
		  It was more like a separation between me and the data that I was working with and then as Sonna which is useful but it didn't again meet my needs about being both planning and a research tool.
		  So that left me with sort of fewer options than I wanted.
		  So in early 2021, in March, I found Rome Research and the small community of active, active users that were active on Twitter including Lapttype.
		  I can't say your name, Laptop Life Lisa who's probably the,
		- Cara Antonaccio 08:29
		  I don't know if you call it the seminal person for my graph.
		  So she's really the person I learned from.
		  I took her magical academic Note taking course.
		  Some of you if you've taken this course, will see a lot of the principles that she taught in this course throughout my graph either explicitly or just you know, variation on her techniques.
		  So she was really influential.
		  And so I used Rome to conduct research and to write my first author publication and I really liked it a lot but
		- Cara Antonaccio 08:59
		  the more I used it, the more I had problems with the pace of growth other issues with, generally wasn't happy with how things were going through.
		  So I started to look in other places and it increasingly seemed to me like Log Zik was, had, had a lot of the same features and was growing at a faster pace than Rome and also had a really healthy community helpful users,
		- Cara Antonaccio 09:23
		  people who are contributing to the app with plug ins with themes and supporting each other in this process of learning and sharing knowledge and integrating knowledge.
		  So at this point, this is where I am today.
		  I'm writing a three paper dissertation in Log Zek and I'll discuss a little bit about each of these papers in a second.
		  But for now I just want to talk a little bit about the processes that I go through here.
		- Cara Antonaccio 09:49
		  So I'll go through each of the sort of, and none of these processes are linear.
		  They're sort of, you know, groupings of similar processes.
		  So searching for things, finding things and adding them to my library.
		  For this, I use Google Scholar and Connected Papers.
		  But just to show you sort of where I throw things this is my library.
		  This is where I keep all of the literature in my literature review.
		  So each,
		- Cara Antonaccio 10:11
		  each article, each book gets its own row and I put the title of it and then I link directly to the source.
		  So this is a source. You can open up the source here and I think this one should have an outline.
		  So for every source, not for every source but for most sources, log gives you the outline of the, the source that you have when you go to this little button here which is really useful for me.
		  So I always start everything that I'm taking notes on or anything that I'm writing
		- Cara Antonaccio 10:39
		  always starts with a tightly structured, clearly articulated, logically consistent outline.
		  And so this is the place that I go to do that.
		  So when I take notes and I'm not sure if I've taken notes on this article yet but it looks like I started to but let's see if I can go back.
		  Sorry. So I've uploaded things into the library.
		  Yeah each source gets a row and I, each
		- Cara Antonaccio 11:04
		  source has a process related to it.
		  So the first step is outlining the second step is referencing and that creates additional linkages in the graph to other articles that, which is super useful for understanding sort of the layout of my literature.
		  I annotate and then I recap everything in a few simple sentences.
		  So that's sort of bringing things into the library finding and adding sources.
		  And again, I use Google Scholar for this and also connected papers which I'll just very briefly show you.
		- Ramses Oudt 11:32
		  So you don't use Zotero
		- Cara Antonaccio 11:34
		  not yet. So I don't like to use a TERO because it overwhelms me when I'm not sure how I'm going to actually use these articles when I'm citing them.
		  So I like to wait until towards the end of my writing process to put all of the different things that I'm citing into Zotero so that it doesn't get mixed together with things that I'm definitely citing and things that I'm just looking through because I might be interested in citing it for some reason or drawing from it.
		- Ramses Oudt 12:01
		  So I think this is also a good lesson.
		  I don't know if it's intentional.
		  So you say once you're done with basically your dissertation, that's or at least a part you will then look into the terror not now like you're not trying to change the wheel of a car while driving.
		  Basically same thing with the process you're not filling too much to upend your process as you're using it.
		  I think that's also an important lesson for, at least for myself.
		- Cara Antonaccio 12:31
		  Yeah so I like to, I, you'll see in my graph I tend to keep things pretty simple.
		  I don't there's not a whole lot of bells and whistles.
		  I like to wait until the end because you know, a lot of things will just become complicated sort of emergent systems tend to become complex just how they are.
		  So I try to keep things intentionally simple so that the more complicated system emerges on its own trying to find something here so that I could show you what it looks like when I'm drafting
		- 참석자 3 13:01
		  just conflict.
		- Cara Antonaccio 13:05
		  So this is one of the drafts of my dissertation.
		  So when I'm citing, close this for now when I'm citing this at this point.
		  So I don't use the Zotero process until the end because what I like to do is when I'm making these arguments, I want to have these sources that I use accessible to me really quickly.
		  So in addition to evidence gaps, certain populations and humanitarian identities have received inadequate attention in the literature.
		  And these three articles speak to,
		- Cara Antonaccio 13:37
		  to those gaps. So I wanted to have those on hand and then later on I'll switch that out with the better BID text citation and I've already sort of started to do that here.
		  So this is how better BIB text names each file, the author's named, the year in the first word.
		  So I already started to sort of follow that convention and I think that it'll make it easier later on to integrate into Zotero.
		- Cara Antonaccio 13:59
		  So that's how I do that's how I sort that's how I site while I'm writing is I put the asset directly into what I'm writing if that gives you an idea of my process until I get to the point of using Zotero.
		  So there's a little bit of a, a tangent there but just to go back.
		  So that's how I bring everything into my library.
		  I use a scholar and connected papers and
		- Cara Antonaccio 14:23
		  before we turn to the next thing, I would love to just show you connected papers because I think if you haven't heard of it before, if you haven't used it, it can be super helpful to understand just the lay of the literature, the seminal works who builds on them.
		  So this is an article, a methods article that I use for my dissertation.
		  So Choy 2021 is the, the articles that I put into the system and then it tells you everything all the papers that have cited Choy or that Choy has cited I guess
		- Cara Antonaccio 14:52
		  and it's a very recent papers and then who they've cited too.
		  So it sort of almost gives you an idea of what your graph would look like you put in all of these different sources into it.
		  So you can go into individual, individual works and you can look at prior works and derivative works.
		  And it also lets you download this as a CSV file.
		  So it can be helpful if you're just trying to get
		- Cara Antonaccio 15:15
		  an idea of what work has been done on a topic or methods that have been used or how much work has been done on a topic because as you can see, a lot of these especially recent so maybe there's not as much of a focus on this as there has been in the past.
		- Ramses Oudt 15:30
		  So this tool actually looks at, when you looked at the, basically the related papers it looks at all the papers in the connected papers database, not just the ones that are in basically your graph you've already saved.
		  So that's a usually useful companion tool if you're already used to this network way of thinking with Luxik that basically have a similar tool.
		  I also saw people recommend research Rabbit.
		  I think that's
		- Cara Antonaccio 15:59
		  research habit's great as well.
		  Y, yea, those are, I should have put research Rabbit here but yeah so these are just some of the tools that I use to bring things into my, I have to bring sources in before I start to review everything and then just some tips again it's okay to start simple it's okay to stay.
		  Logik is built on top of your computer's existing file structure.
		  So for each asset that you upload and to do that, you just do this
		- Cara Antonaccio 16:26
		  and then it brings you all the files.
		  So for every asset you upload, it creates a markdown file with a consistent naming convention and organizes your literature along with automatically.
		  So I find it's really useful to just use the note page that it creates for each, each asset and just take notes there so that it's easily organized.
		- Cara Antonaccio 16:50
		  So the next step that I'd use in my research is the next sort of set of processes that I use is organizing, outlining reading, learning and just sort of absorbing my library.
		  So this is an example of an article I'll just move this over.
		  This is an example of an article that is important for my dissertation here.
		  So I start off again with this outline.
		  So I'll just basically copy each header and then take notes under each of them.
		  So
		- Cara Antonaccio 17:20
		  I just summarizing the whole thing in my own words and, and then you're sure, you know, you've, already, you've annotated it but you already know that you're annotating in your own words.
		  So you can be sure that you're not plagiarizing or that you'll have any copyright issues because as you're annotating it, you're doing it in your own words so you're processing it, you're learning and you're able to take from what you learned and bring it right into your own writing.
		  So yeah, I guess I,
		- Ramses Oudt 17:48
		  yeah it's writing notes in your own words instead of highlighting and then copying over the highlight which you could do also in luxik you could basically highlight something and then I, I, the question was also in the chat when you highlight something in a PDF automatically copies the block reference to that highlight within the PDF to your clipboard.
		  So when you then paste it in a block
		- Ramses Oudt 18:11
		  and then even if you want, you can just hit Enter and then tap and then as a child block take your notes.
		  That is how I have done a lot of research that way.
		  So I would basically just take a bunch of block references, highlights from the PDFS that I was reading and then take the notes underneath.
		  It's a similar process. I'm just maybe an information hoarder.
		  I always want to see okay what inspired a note I'm not even sure if it's necessary in your case but
		- Ramses Oudt 18:40
		  there are different approaches to basically the same thing.
		  But I agree with you writing things in your own words is key also pleasures but then also just learning things and writing things, explaining things in your own word also will make that you remember it better.
		  Is my experience and also research.
		  Yes
		- Cara Antonaccio 18:58
		  yeah. So and I think you make a really good point here that like you're going to see a lot of stuff in my graph that's just not going to work for you.
		  You know, this works for me this works for my needs but your use cases probably just different.
		  So take from this what is useful for you and leave what isn't is what I've found is the best approach.
		  So this sort of aspect of my research processes involve analysis, practicing technique, data validating, my models,
		- Cara Antonaccio 19:25
		  cross validating and I do this both in log ZEK and in other tools.
		  So to give you an example of what this looks like in Log Seek.
		  So I'm writing my discitation part of the analysis is in art.
		  So I just brought in the read me directly from GitHub for this algorithm MBSB DB scan.
		  And so I'm writing the code for my desitation in,
		- Cara Antonaccio 19:49
		  in logs and it makes it nice because I could just, you know, reference anytime I'm working on it, just reference the code directly and it's already here.
		  It takes all of the takes.
		  This is literally our code.
		  So this is, you can look at it in this way like it's in the outline or you can work on it as though it's the frame here.
		  So it's really useful to be able to do this in my graph and, and then also Lucid Chart is another tool that I use in this sort of knowledge synthesis and integration and
		- Cara Antonaccio 20:21
		  modeling the ideas that I'm seeing.
		  So I use Lucid Chart to diagram.
		  I know that LOCKSK has a lot of options for diagramming but I find that it's nice to be able to make things in Lucid Chart and then I export them as SVG files and then I bring them into log seats.
		  So that's what that's, you'll see in my dissertation files there's diagrams that came from lucid tables in log seat.
		  Is there anything you wanted to touch on on
		- Cara Antonaccio 20:52
		  this process? I think there's a lot that I could go into here about that I can talk all the time about.
		- Ramses Oudt 20:56
		  I do want to point out how much I like that.
		  He used Lucy Chart and actually next week and it's a little bit unrelated but next week there's a session with Dario Suttering Mind on YouTube and we're actually going to talk about using diagrams to plan workflows.
		  So you already basically gave a sneak peak how you use it to think through your, our script.
		  This also gives me the idea that we should have some kind of
		- Ramses Oudt 21:21
		  called Juniper Notebook type of functionality within Luxig.
		  That would be really cool.
		  But yeah, using diagrams to think through a process and we'll be talking about workflow design for we'll post the link later in the chat.
		  There are some questions but let's just keep going because the questions are a little bit unrelated so they are off topic.
		  Questions more about oh, your LOXK looks pretty how do you create these links how do you add icons? But we'll get to that later if there's time.
		- Cara Antonaccio 21:50
		  Yeah I'll save some time at the end for discussion so I'm happy to answer anything like that later on.
		  Yeah. So this is just, this is some of the analysis planning that I do.
		  I also use Log Seek to propose, create, write and edit different things.
		  So typically what I'm writing is a journal articles sometimes I'm writing opinion papers but I wanted to show you this example of this is one of my dissertation papers.
		  So anything that I'm writing, I outline it in the same way that I outline
		- Cara Antonaccio 22:22
		  things that I'm reading.
		  So I started everything out in the same way and just, you know, put all the headings in and then write your tightly structured, clearly articulated logic.
		  It's an outline and then I do all the siting.
		  And then logik is really nice.
		  I use a lot of equations so logik uses latex so I'm able to put all of my equations directly into
		- Cara Antonaccio 22:42
		  log seek. I haven't exported anything with the equations yet into HTML or anything like that.
		  So I'm not sure how nicely it'll work bringing it into a word if I ever have to do but it's really nice to be able to draft and write math in the log sequence.
		  And then here you see this is one of the figures that I made in Lucid Chart and it's just an asset that I uploaded here.
		  You saw these diagrams in Lucid Chart as well.
		  So this is sort of how
		- Cara Antonaccio 23:10
		  these things get injected into my graph at different points.
		  And then yeah and then you know, again, even just in, in my working draft I have this AR code which you create by it's like text, create texts empty and then I think what you can do is this is actually R so this becomes R here.
		  So it takes a little bit of working around to get things exactly how you need them to be.
		  But it's really nice to be able to, it's like multimodal almost that you can do different things all at once.
		- Cara Antonaccio 23:40
		  So this is what a draft looks like as I'm working on it I don't usually export things as an outline.
		  I'll typically make each paragraph its own bullet but as I'm working through my ideas and as I'm making sure that I have arguments where they need to be, I usually just do one sentence per block or one idea per block.
		- Ramses Oudt 23:59
		  Another great smart notes principle.
		  And this is actually a question also that I saw several times in the chat how like what is so now we're looking basically at your research and production process.
		  And what you say now is you also write everything in Lockik or up to a point that you because I can imagine that exporting out of lockk can be a challenge.
		  How do you do that? Like do you export to HDML and then you copy it into word or Google Docs
		- Cara Antonaccio 24:34
		  The nice thing about exporting two word with HTML is that when you copy it as HTML, the headings just become the word same headings from word but it's harder for with the lay text formatting where it doesn't use lay text it uses an equation builder so it can be easier to export these as images just like screenshot them as images and put them into words like that.
		  But it's pretty seamless
		- Cara Antonaccio 25:01
		  just because of the heading mapping.
		  So as long as you stay consistent with your levels of headings, the board will do the same thing.
		  And, and it can be pretty se mess to do.
		- Ramses Oudt 25:12
		  Yeah I recently found the same I was struggling with exporting because if you export to plain text, it's, it's not always nice because you don't have basically the wide spaces between the paragraphs.
		  But when you then export to HTML, just copy to clipboard and in my case I just copy to Google Dock also works perfectly like the headings everything renders perfectly.
		  So and there's actually also,
		- Ramses Oudt 25:40
		  I think Arian Sanny today released an export to PDF plug in.
		  I'm not sure if it's already in the marketplace.
		  We were actually going to add support or export functionally to Luxik itself.
		  I'm not sure how much we'll do.
		  I saw Pandoc mentioned Yeah that is one of the things we are looking as a Loxic team to implement natively into Loxic.
		  But obviously now that Arian Sanni has
		- Ramses Oudt 26:06
		  release the plug in for PDF export not so sure necessary to rush that functionality but all feedback is welcome on that.
		  Just approach me on the Discord if you have ideas on that.
		- Cara Antonaccio 26:18
		  So I saw a comment in the chat I'm sorry I haven't been monitoring the chat so just
		- Ramses Oudt 26:24
		  I've been monitoring the chat and writing down questions.
		  So yeah, one question was about your graph and also how you explore relationships basically.
		- Cara Antonaccio 26:34
		  Yeah that's what I wanted to show here is sort of what it ends up looking like that I have.
		  So I have an attribute for authors.
		  So each article that I have has an attribute for tags and an attribute for, for who wrote it and like where they cited.
		  So each article has these are a lot of citations.
		- Cara Antonaccio 26:53
		  I also have the author's names.
		  Different authors get connected to different topics and certain articles are more cited certain topics are more cited.
		  So my dissertation uses a method called the random Forests.
		  So sort of you see that everything is sort of clustered around this random forest.
		  There's a ton of different references to it and mostly these are just different articles.
		  So this is work for Wenzi.
		  So you can see this is the notes page here
		- Cara Antonaccio 27:19
		  and you have, this is one of the authors and then these are the different topics and different articles that they cite too.
		  So it's like you can see sort of the lay of your literature and how these different clusters relate to each other and to the broader sort of literature base.
		  And I'm really excited to see I know that Rome had a nice plug in for making this a more useful.
		- Ramses Oudt 27:41
		  This discourse plug in Yeah by Jill Chen he created that because of a grant he was given.
		  Yeah it's on our basically research roadmap to have conversations with him.
		  Obviously it's, I think it's an open source plug in but Roam and Luxic are very different under the hood.
		  It's, it's, it would be very useful because basically now you only see what pages are links.
		  But with the discourse plug in you could basically have, create your own grammar so like your own argumentation grammar.
		  So
		- Ramses Oudt 28:16
		  this source supports that or this source contradicts that.
		  And so that is very useful definitely on our roadmap to dive deeper into.
		  But it's, we're still in the research phase.
		  We've seen the plug in by Joel.
		  We went to talk to him he offered to talk to us.
		  So it's, things are happening but I can tell, I cannot say anything on the timelines unfortunately but just know that we're actively looking into making Luxic way more powerful specifically for researchers and academic researchers.
		- Cara Antonaccio 28:49
		  Rock on I see that PDF exploit is now available which is super useful.
		  Yeah so this is my graph view.
		  It's sort of messy now but if we're getting there eventually, there should be, you know, nice little clusters where every single one has a circle around it and they're all linked to each other.
		  But it's a process. And these are the tools that I use for analysis.
		  Again, Log Seek, Lucy Chart are Python and I do all of my coding, all the planning for coding in,
		- Cara Antonaccio 29:17
		  in log Seat just because it's easier for me to write and think and read and plan all in one place.
		  And the next step is proposing creating, writing, editing.
		  And then again, this is a dissertation draft and then submission presenting.
		  So I haven't yet presented anything aside from this in logs but I do tend to use Canva and I'll show you that really quick.
		  Canva is nice because it does all of the
		- Cara Antonaccio 29:44
		  what do you call it animations for you automatically.
		  And so it's nice to just be able and then you can, I usually export the outline of my presentation and bring the outline into log Zek.
		  So I have, I can basically just like read through what I'm doing as I present.
		  So that's that 5th process of, I mean I'm always somewhere in the middle of all these processes at the same time
		- Cara Antonaccio 30:09
		  10 different projects going and they're all at a different stage.
		  So it's non linear it's iterative and it's, I'm always changing how things work and how I manage things.
		  So that's everything that I had in terms of like explicit things to look at
		- Ramses Oudt 30:25
		  there's more than enough questions there are more than enough questions.
		  So first of all, thank you so much.
		  I love really seeing the setup and I'm really happy to see that you do basically everything in lux because normally personally I'm against it.
		  I also don't encourage normally people using one tool for everything because I really believe in best of breed tools.
		  But then looking at your process,
		- Ramses Oudt 30:56
		  it looks like it's really well integrated.
		  There are no obvious friction points that I can see that would force you to look at other tools.
		  So that really gives me a lot of hope.
		  Obviously there's some things that we could improve like the like the discourse graph plug in if we could add that I know there are some things with Zotero.
		  There was a question actually about this yeah because people saw, hey, there are, how do you use less cards and I see you're learning Suahili
		- Cara Antonaccio 31:28
		  yeah so I took Sohilian College have done some work in East Africa.
		  So one of the ways that I use flash cards what I'm trying to procrastinate is by teaching myself a Sohili I have for each each I have it both Swahili to English and English to Swahili.
		  So if I open up the flash cards I've got almost 300 of them.
		  So this is father. So I show the clothes I said father and
		- Cara Antonaccio 31:53
		  I remember it and then it just goes through my entire and then as soon as I get, soon as I get sick of doing it, I just close it out and move on to whatever's next.
		  So it's a productive way to procrastinate and it's, it's, it's a way to sort of make sure that you know, I'm using that repetitive learning.
		- Ramses Oudt 32:12
		  Yeah well, I'm addicted to language learning.
		  So I personally I use anky for flesh cards because I have audio flesh cards and it's a little bit much of a hassle to do that in Loxy currently hopefully they will improve soon.
		  Actually I've also been thinking of some, some workflow to incorporate flash cards basically to expose yourself to notes over time.
		  So now that the flash card functionality has been fixed a little bit, you can directly edit a flash card and add child blocks
		- Ramses Oudt 32:47
		  while reviewing the cards.
		  So what I've been thinking about is taking a Zetto casted approach but more question based.
		  So have a question and then progressively expand on my notes.
		  So instead of really using it to memorize things, it's more to program my attention.
		  So I'm not clicking show answer to test myself.
		  It's more show answer, read the notes that I already have and then expand upon those notes.
		  So because as it's over time and I'm doing reviews, I might think of
		- Ramses Oudt 33:28
		  maybe some paper that I recently read but I haven't linked to that note yet.
		  So or some other source or maybe some conversation that I had or a video that I saw.
		  So that way you could use flash cards.
		  I'm thinking of doing either a session about that or just recording a video about that.
		  But because I think that will be interesting for many people for language learning I've basically mastered Spanish I would say through flash cards mostly and watching a lot of cartoons.
		  So let's see what other
		- Ramses Oudt 33:59
		  questions are there. So the question was answered how do you use flash cards? Then let's see there were many, many questions about your CSS.
		  So what theme are you using? What other sprinkles do you have? Maybe you could link to some things where you could just show
		- Cara Antonaccio 34:33
		  yep so it's available in the marketplace I don't really add a whole lot to it.
		  The way that I do the, the tag styles is if you type shift well I use a MAC so shift command P and then it's this first option here modify block reference styles and you might have to add this plug in in the plug in store but it's in there.
		  So when you go in here so I've got a ton of different plug in styles.
		  You can see that some of them are blank because they didn't there's an issue when you
		- Cara Antonaccio 34:59
		  out of them that when you try to delete them that some of these colors overlap into other references.
		  So some of them are just empty they don't do anything but all of the different processes that I have, all the different topics that are important for my work they all get their own block reference tag.
		  And then anytime you just like, say, for example, I wanted to look at my library.
		  I just do the regular block reference for library and it puts the books there.
		  So it's really nice
		- 참석자 3 35:26
		  it was really nice.
		- Cara Antonaccio 35:27
		  Yeah and you know, it's kind of, it's a little bit overkill.
		- Ramses Oudt 35:32
		  Well, it helps navigate.
		  It's basically they are signposts because you have a Mooji in front you basically can scan the page more easily and just find what you're looking for.
		  I would argue.
		- Cara Antonaccio 35:45
		  And honestly this might be a little bit of a reach but it's kind of also an accessibility thing when you think about it.
		  So I work with a lot of folks who are native English speaker.
		  So if they're trying to interpret, if they're in my log and they're trying to read what I'm writing and there's unfamiliar words, it might be easier for them to interpret.
		  You know, if it's tagged with an icon, that might be, you know, just language help.
		  But yeah so
		- Ramses Oudt 36:13
		  all right so that is, oh, yeah and something else you have the weather info on your journal's page is that automatically when you run
		- Cara Antonaccio 36:22
		  it's not. So I put that in there.
		  The way that I do each daily journal is every night.
		  I do the one for the next day.
		  So it helps me to get my mind in the mode of what's tomorrow going to look like.
		  Well, tomorrow's going to be two degrees Celsius cloudy pop all that information in the night before.
		  It would be really bada if anyone wants to write a plug in or get the weather for B.
		- Ramses Oudt 36:49
		  By the way, there is a way to automatically generate a, basically your daily template.
		  Obviously when it's hands on like Gara does, you would want to run it manually.
		  But I've written an article about how you can set up an automated daily template so that runs every night at midnight as the new journals page is generated.
		  Yeah there's no weather plug in.
		  As far as I know, there were some questions about basically your
		- Ramses Oudt 37:18
		  templates. And if you use attributes someone also said that you shared a reading notes template on Twitter maybe you could are you able to show a little bit from that?
		- Cara Antonaccio 37:33
		  I could so I might not have saved that template.
		  It's sort of a template that I like.
		  I wrote it out because it's a process that I implement intuitively but it's nice to have it all in one place.
		  So it's sort of I think it was like why do I want to read this? I'll, I can send it to you Ramses and sounded around but to talk a little bit about the attributes.
		  So some of the attributes that I use are tags and these are these
		- Cara Antonaccio 38:00
		  this is a plug in so the tags plug in.
		  So these are all the tags that I have in my graph and then I also use one for authors.
		  So so that's an attribute and then publisher or journal is another one attributes that I use.
		  And then this a question that I saw oh, is it possible to assign a specific color to tags? And I was trying to show that before a little bit.
		  But when you go to the
		- Cara Antonaccio 38:24
		  block reference styles, you can just do it right here it's like a color picker so you can do that also.
		  The other thing I wanted to show is in custom CSS, I have any, anytime I hashtag something so if I do like hashtag, it becomes like a, a different type of CSS style.
		  So I added that in my custom CSS so I can send this around with that template as well.
		  So you can,
		- Cara Antonaccio 38:50
		  you know, change that however you want.
		  But yeah so just making things pretty I don't know if you're not having fun it's harder to focus.
		  So that's what I find.
		- Ramses Oudt 39:02
		  Yeah. And someone asks Bob he says I'm confused by these tags.
		  When I put a hashtag into Lexic it links my blog to the page for that hashtag.
		  Archara tags a totally different thing altogether.
		  It's cosmatic
		- Cara Antonaccio 39:14
		  the CSS that I showed here.
		  So this custom CSS for those tags typically a tag will just be like a hashtag, whatever but I added this CSS for a tag.
		  It has a background that's gray and has white writing.
		  It's got this sort of padding so you can see it in this processes tech here and then you specify how you want it to look using these different parameters.
		  So I can, I'll put the CSS in the chart so you can just grab it if you want.
		- Ramses Oudt 39:39
		  Yeah and JKA is asking, please do share the template for booknotes Do you have a standard template for that or do you just start from scratch?
		- Cara Antonaccio 39:47
		  I have a process written out and I can share that.
		  So for each source, what is a person trying to say is their structure clear and logical? And that's sort of what I'm trying to figure out when I'm doing the outlining process what's their thesis? Just write it out what claims do they make? What evidence do they give to substantiate those claims?
		- Cara Antonaccio 40:04
		  Am I convinced that what they're arguing is logical and consistent definitions that they use and how, specifically how it informs my work Why am I going to need this? When am I going to want to see this later on? And then general feelings and yeah so for definitions like I'll, I'll just have the regular page but then I'll also hashtag it like topics or define or something like that.
		  So I have a process for processes.
		  Everything is just a bunch of processes.
		- Cara Antonaccio 40:33
		  So each group of processes gets their own process and each processes yeah it's all process.
		  So talking is a process contacting people all processes within this process.
		  Birdies my cat, she has a process.
		  This is where I get all of the different whether you're saying this is my research process, searching, adding, it's the library reading blah, blah, blah.
		  This week has a process. So each week detailed all the activities for the week my house, my schedule and life.
		- Cara Antonaccio 41:01
		  And yeah so everything gets its own process.
		  All the processes end up on this process page and anytime I want to edit them, I can just do that from here.
		- Ramses Oudt 41:11
		  You even have a process to define the process.
		  I love it. Let's see what other questions are there.
		  I find this a very good question by Neil.
		  So what do you need but don't have? And this is also something good for us to learn as a LUX team.
		- Cara Antonaccio 41:29
		  That's a really good question.
		  I feel like I feel like I have most of the things that I need.
		  It's really that I need to use the tools that are available to me like Zotero and I don't do a whole lot of querying which I think I could really benefit from.
		  So I think I need to sort of take my, take, my analog graph to a more automated level.
		  You know what I mean I do a lot.
		  I do a lot of templates on my own just like copy and pasting.
		  I think I could make things work on their own better you know
		- Cara Antonaccio 42:03
		  so that's really where my next steps are is using what's available to me.
		  I know that there's, I have this, this calendar.
		  It's really just making use of what's available but I'm interested in also if I could take away the bullets if I could just have like outlining without bullets.
		- Ramses Oudt 42:26
		  So yesterday during our internal meeting so we have all hands every two weeks with the internal team we had a long, long discussion about basically long form writing.
		  So it's definitely on our, it's currently on our research roadmap but we have to solve quite a few things with the editor.
		  So it's one of the most requested features on the forum.
		  It's completely within our sight.
		  We know what we would need to change but it's quite a bit of things we would need to change about the editor.
		- Ramses Oudt 43:03
		  So we're looking for some, some workarounds for the meanwhile.
		  So improving export is an intermediate step to make it friendlier for long form writing.
		  So you can easily export for example to word or PDF without the bullets, clean, cleaner layout, cleaning up links, all that kind of stuff.
		- Cara Antonaccio 43:27
		  It looks like someone is having trouble with exporting to word and I want to show really because there's a very specific way you have to do it.
		  So I want to make sure that I show how to do it so that you can get those headings to work.
		  So just let me just show. So I'm going to export this document, export the page and then go to HTML and don't try to copy it like go in here and like control see you have to copy the clipboard down here and then when you go into,
		- Cara Antonaccio 44:00
		  when you go into word then once you've copied it from down here.
		- Ramses Oudt 44:11
		  Yeah the only downside obviously is as you'll see now it has the bullets but you can remove them right and word quite easily.
		  I think
		- Cara Antonaccio 44:21
		  yep. So what I do is I just change the over here, change it so that everything is aligned on the left.
		  I'm not doing it because there's a thing here and then I remove all of the tags and I basically just like realign everything so that it ends up being a.
		  So this is what it ends up looking like.
		  It's still a little bit you know, you still have to do some fixing things
		- Cara Antonaccio 44:53
		  but ultimately it ends up like this is heading one I think or this is maybe the title but you might have to reassign them if you want to use a table of contents but you can get the text in there.
		- Ramses Oudt 45:03
		  So the answer is it's not completely horrible.
		- Ramses Oudt 45:09
		  Yeah I saw Pendock mentioned yeah that is on our radar.
		  We are looking into Pendock that would solve probably not all of these issues.
		- Cara Antonaccio 45:21
		  Again I can really doing the easiest way I can.
		  So there are ways to make things work better than I'm making them work.
		- Ramses Oudt 45:28
		  Yeah. And Iran mentioned that there is basically some kind of document mode if you press TD so tuggle documents.
		  Yeah personally I don't really like this view but I'm very perfectionist so it works I think different like you can also control using the CSS how far the, the spacing is between the paragraphs so you could make it nicer looking.
		  But basically there's a document mode under the hood
		- Ramses Oudt 46:02
		  still has basically bullets in front of every block.
		  So there's definitely some work that we will need to do.
		  Ideal the shortcut is Tea of Theodore and then D of Delta Tango Delta.
		  That's so we are on the top of the hour.
		  I think we covered all the questions.
		  I got to share a little bit about our plans for the current shortcomings but I'm really happy to see all in all how much you're able to do basically already just directly within Lxik.
		- Ramses Oudt 46:38
		  So that is a great takeaway.
		  You are on Discord so, and, but I think you're mostly active on Twitter so I will put your Twitter handle, the chat and Kara Antonakio is also your Discord handle.
		  If you have questions for me, my Twitter handle is as follows so are out and then I'll also enter my Discord user name.
		  So if you have any questions, the best way is to send me a DM on this chord.
		  If you have any feedback on how we could make LUXG better for academic research.
		  I saw several people
		- Ramses Oudt 47:23
		  I mentioned Ellid for example, Research Rabbit.
		  So with Elicid, we're actually now researching if we could create some kind of integration so that you can basically trigger illicit within Lockk.
		  Again, it's in a research phase.
		  We have many things in the research phase but we try once we have figured out how to do something, we always try to shift very quickly.
		  So you'll start hearing us talk more about certain features once we have figured out how to do something.
		  So for now
		- Ramses Oudt 47:52
		  to give you a sense of the roadmap for now, we're mostly focused on the SC so you will not have to use icloud for example, anymore or GID Hub.
		  So we are working on an encrypted sync service which basically will be part of our monetization.
		  So the app itself, Lexic will always remain free but we will offer additional services a little bit like Absinian does so they have a sync service, they have a published service.
		  So we're looking also into
		- Ramses Oudt 48:21
		  basically adjacent services but the core app will always remain free and then after that after the SNC is ready, we are going to put a lot of focus on real time collaboration.
		  So in the future it will like Lexic will also become a tool that you can use basically in teams to hopefully work on papers together.
		  So that will be in the near future.
		  Again, if you have any questions or comments, please reach out to me via DM either on Twitter or Discord.
		  The recording will be
		- Ramses Oudt 48:54
		  published on YouTube Hopefully tomorrow I think tomorrow today I will be editing at KARA anything from you you want to share
		- Cara Antonaccio 49:04
		  nothing specific but you know always If anyone has any questions or suggestions, I know some people were suggesting things in the chat, feel free to DM me on Twitter.
		  My email address is on my website and my website address is on Twitter so feel free to contact me with questions or if you want to chat.
		  And thanks for everyone for joining.
		  I hope you learned something and I'm looking forward to learning more in Langsk with all of you.
		- Ramses Oudt 49:31
		  Great thank you so much. This was it was very useful for me, I think for many people here and hopefully we'll see you back in the future for another workflow Wednesday Have a great day by everyone.
